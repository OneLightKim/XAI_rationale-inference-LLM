Reaction on the Wall Street Journal\\'s MarketBeat Blog was swift: \"Woah!!! Bad number.\" The unemployment rate, however, is better news; it had been expected to hold steady at 8.3%.

As for her stake in the Los Angeles Clippers, she plans to keep it, the AP notes. Sterling says she would \"absolutely\" fight any NBA decision to force her to sell the team. The team is her \"legacy\" to her family, she says. \"To be honest with you, I\\'m wondering if a wife of one of the owners … said those racial slurs, would they oust the husband?

Three people are dead, but the count could grow. A Montgomery County Fire rep says three fliers were killed in the crash, but notes the corporate plane may have had a fourth person on board, reports the AP. A relative of the owner of the home that was hit tells WUSA 9 that a mother with three children pre-school age and under should have been home at the time; there\\'s no word on the family\\'s whereabouts. The crash occurred around 11am on Drop Forge Lane, and the fire was extinguished within an hour. Crews are now searching the wreckage.

His first attempt at an apology, which he tweeted the next morning: \"Apparently Charlie Sheen got control of my Twitter account last night while I was at dinner. Apologies for his behavior.” That wasn\\'t good enough for many conservative women, Politico notes, rounding up reactions from bloggers to Michelle Malkin calling his behavior sexist and misogynistic. By late Tuesday, Carlson had offered up a more sincere-sounding apology: “I’m sorry for last night’s tweet. I meant absolutely no offense. Not the first dumb thing I’ve said.

The correct answer is \"amateur testicle surgery.\" The BBC reports 56-year-old Allan Matthews pleaded guilty Wednesday to removing another man\\'s left testicle at an Australian motel despite not being qualified to practice medicine. The unsanctioned surgery took place in May after a 52-year-old man posted an ad online seeking help for a medical issue, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. The man was apparently still suffering after being kicked in the groin by a horse years earlier but couldn\\'t afford an actual doctor. A week after Matthews allegedly removed the man\\'s testicle, infection set in. The man went to the hospital, and the police launched an investigation. Authorities say a raid of Matthews\\' home last month turned up medical equipment, seven guns, and four bottles of what may be amyl nitrate. In addition to performing surgery without being a doctor, Matthews also pleaded guilty to gun and drug charges. He did not plead guilty to inflicting \"reckless grievous bodily harm.\" AAP reports Matthews is out on bail until another hearing next month.

       " '– Education Secretary John King has a message for states where physical discipline is permitted in schools, per USA Today: Quit it. In a letter to governors and state school chiefs, King says 22 states—mostly in the South and West—still allow corporal punishment or don\\'t forbid it. He implores them to stop the \"harmful\" and \"ineffective\" practice, saying it teaches kids that getting physical is OK to solve problems. He also points out that some corporal punishment taking place in schools would be considered criminal assault or battery in real-world settings. About 80 groups—including the NAACP—lent their support to a similar letter penned Monday by the National Women\\'s Law Center, reports CBS News. \"Corporal punishment of adults has been banned in prisons and in military training facilities, and it\\'s time we do the same for our nation\\'s schoolchildren,\" an NWLC rep says. King also notes that physical punishment isn\\'t applied equitably to all students. For example, even though black students make up about 16% of attendees in public elementary and secondary schools, they\\'re on the receiving end of one-third of the corporal punishment. Boys are subjected to 80% of such acts, while students with disabilities also tend to be victims more so than other students. \"These data and disparities shock the conscience,\" King writes. (Alabama paddled 19K students in one school year.)\\n',\n",
       " '– A massive leak of fracking fluid poured into the streets of Arlington, Texas, two months ago and forced the evacuation of a hundred homes. Now city officials have taken Vantage Energy to task for its \"unacceptable\" handling of the 43,000-gallon spill, WFAA reports. During a city council meeting yesterday, it emerged that Vantage had taken nearly two hours to call 911 despite the risk of a gas leak. \"This is unacceptable behavior,\" says an Arlington city council member. According to Fire Chief Don Crowson, the two-hour delay was no joke: \"We’re not kidding around about the 911 issue,\" he tells the Star-Telegram during a break in city council. \"It could have ended in a bad outcome. Two hours’ advance notice could have helped a lot.\" Still, officials say the environmental damage was not extensive and Vantage has been cooperative. So what happened, exactly? According to the city\\'s report, a Vantage well site sprung a leak on April 11, which allowed fracking water and chemicals to boil up into Arlington\\'s streets, storm sewers, and streams. Because the fracking fluid had been fracturing shale and freeing gas under high pressure, natural gas could have leaked at any time. Now WFAA says a 1,500-gallon spill occurred at the same location a month before, and NBC-Dallas/Fort Worth reports that the site is close to reopening. \"I just assumed this was a residential area and it would be free from industrial hazardous operations,\" says a resident after hearing about the earlier spill. \"Now we see it\\'s not.\"\\n',\n",

But here\\'s where he allegedly diverges: According to CBS Los Angeles, 44-year-old Gonzales has been dining and dashing at area restaurants, leaving behind unsuspecting women he\\'s asked out on blind dates. CBS reported in August that Gonzales had left two women to pay the bill after walking out on restaurant dates last summer. One of the women described how he\\'d eaten $100 worth of food at a restaurant in Long Beach—explaining he had to order two entrees because he\\'s a bodybuilder—before saying he was going to the bathroom. She never saw him again. Now, the man Grub Street identifies as perhaps \"the world\\'s worst dinner date\" appears to have struck again. A woman, identified by WTOL as Beth, says she met \"Dave Gonzales\" on Bumble before agreeing to dinner at a restaurant in Pasadena. Gonzales ordered \"a glass of pinot, a Caesar salad with a side of shrimp, a steak, and a baked potato\" and ate most of the meal before excusing himself to take a phone call, Beth says. He never returned, a text went unanswered, and his Bumble profile was later removed, adds Beth, who soon after learned of Gonzales\\' alleged notoriety. She says she wants his \"disgusting\" ruse to stop. According to police, Gonzales has also walked out of a salon, still clad in a smock, without paying for a haircut and color. He\\'s wanted on two bench warrants as a result of misdemeanor charges, including petty theft. (This blind date was more shocking.)\\n',\n",

When lawyers for British Airways showed up in his court to argue a $4.6 billion price-fixing case, Smith had smaller fish to fry: He wanted to know why the airline lost his luggage on a recent trip to Italy, reports the Legal Cheek blog. The questioning of BA counsel Jon Turner is priceless, as relayed by the Independent: \"Mr Turner, here is a question for you. What happened to [the] luggage?” When Turner replies that they\\'re actually in court for a different matter, Smith won\\'t be put off: “In that case, do you want me to order your chief executive to appear before me today?” Turner again tries to deflect the questioning, but Smith responds, “What is inappropriate is the continued failure of your clients to explain a simple question: namely, what happened to the luggage? It has been two weeks since that happened now.\" This goes on for a while, and the BA lawyers ask Smith to recuse himself from the case they\\'re supposed to be arguing because he\\'s biased. Smith reluctantly agrees to do so. Entertaining yes, but whether it was good judgeship remains to be seen—the Times of London reports that judicial conduct authorities are investigating. The same judge once inserted a secret message (\"Smithy Code\") into his ruling in a copyright case involving the Da Vinci Code, notes the Telegraph.

Authorities say half the tires on the bus he was driving, including both steer axle tires, were worn down to an unsafe level, which would have been enough for inspectors to take the bus out of service, the AP reports. The bus, which was on its way to Los Angeles from the Red Earth Casino in Salton Sea Beach, plowed into the back of a big rig and it\\'s not clear whether Vides attempted to brake first. The full National Transportation Safety Board investigation could take up to a year. Vides, 59, had been sued twice for negligence over incidents involving his USA Holiday company, which is listed as having just one bus, the Los Angeles Times reports. In a 2007 incident, three people died when a USA Holiday bus hit a Honda Civic on a freeway in Riverside, Calif. The company also received at least six \"unsatisfactory\" ratings from the California Highway Patrol for issues including maintenance, and Vides had several traffic citations on his record. The victims, whose ages range from 50 to 72, were mostly seated near the front of the bus, reports the Press Enterprise. Another 31 people were injured.\\n',\n",

There was a character who kicked the cartoon bucket, but it wasn\\'t exactly a major one: It was Rabbi Hyman Krustofski, Krusty the Clown\\'s dad, voiced by comedian Jackie Mason, a character that only appeared in \"a handful\" of episodes, the Times notes. Reaction to the \"Clown in the Dumps\" episode ranged from mild, NPR-style disappointment to outright irritation: Tim Donnelly writes in the New York Post that the death (and preceding teasers) were \"a lame play for attention by a show desperate to stay relevant.\" One Twitter user quoted in the Times complained, \"Krusty\\'s dad died... Um, Krusty had a Dad? Never heard of him. Wasted anticipation.\" Producer Al Jean insists he has always said the untimely death was \"overhyped\" and that he never promised it would be one of the more-popular characters. \"I never said it’s an iconic character—I never used those words,\" he tells Entertainment Weekly. In fact, he assures fans that favorites will never be purposely annihilated before series\\' end. \"We\\'re never going to kill off Homer, or even Krusty,\" he tells TVLine. \"This show is always running in syndication, and we don\\'t want you to feel bad every time you see an old character that you loved.\"\\n',\n",

The Obama administration announced a $1.8 billion arms package sale to Congress on Wednesday, Reuters reports, including guided-missile frigates, anti-tank missiles, Amphibious Assault Vehicles, and $416 million worth of guns, ammo, and other supplies. The announcement came amid reports that the US had stalled the sale to avoid hearing about it from China, which still claims Taiwan as a territory, per the Wall Street Journal. Reuters notes the sale comes as US-China relations simmer over the latter\\'s man-made islands in the South China Sea and US patrols in those waters. China notes it\\'s going to sanction the companies involved in the sale (including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon), with a foreign ministry official telling Xinhua that the sale flouts international rules and \"severely\" damages China\\'s sovereignty. \"China\\'s government and companies will not carry out cooperation and commercial dealings with these types of companies,\" a ministry spokesman says. A Pentagon spokesman gave the equivalent of an eyeroll Wednesday, per the New York Times, noting, \"The Chinese can react to this as they see fit. … It\\'s a [clear-eyed], sober view of an assessment of Taiwan\\'s defense needs. … There\\'s no need for it to have any derogatory effect on our relationship with China.\" Meanwhile, the AP notes that China has issued similar threats before, with \"no evidence they\\'ve had any meaningful effect.\" (All this despite a lengthy handshake last month.)\\n',\n",

The findings will be detailed by researchers from Belgium\\'s Ghent University and the University of Ghana at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Denver, and center around how antioxidant-rich the sweet is. As a press release explains, it all comes down to tweaking the process. Cocoa beans are removed from pods, fermented in baskets, sun-dried, and then roasted. It\\'s during that last step, the roasting, that polyphenols, which act as antioxidants, are partially lost. In a bid to up the polyphenol content, researchers added a nontraditional step that \"makes our research fundamentally different,\" explains Emmanuel Ohene Afoakwa: pulp preconditioning. That simply means they stored the pods—in the case of their experiments, for zero, three, seven, or 10 days—before removing the beans and beginning the fermentation process. A sweet pulp rests between the pod and the beans, and Afoakwa believes the preconditioning gives the pulp time to affect those beans. Indeed, the researchers found that those stored for a week showed the highest antioxidant activity after roasting—which they also adjusted. Rather than heat the beans for the typical 10 to 20 minutes at 248-266 degrees, they lowered the temp to 242 and upped the roasting time to 45 minutes, and discovered that slower and lower was also best in terms of antioxidant activity. The researchers\\' abstract notes another benefit: \"Pulp preconditioning and roasting duration could be used to reduce the astringency and bitterness,\" improving chocolate\\'s flavor.

Politico reports Mulvaney was up for re-election in the House (he won), and referred to Trump and Hillary Clinton during a South Carolina debate as \"perhaps two of the most flawed human beings running for president in the history of the country\" when asked whether he was throwing his support behind the GOP candidate. He zeroed in on Trump specifically, saying \"Do I like Donald Trump? No\" and noting he didn\\'t see Trump as a role model for his sons. And there\\'s this: \"Yes, I am supporting Donald Trump, but I’m doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact that I think he’s a terrible human being. But the choice on the other side is just as bad.\" USA Today reports it was only hours after the Mulvaney news broke on Friday that the Daily Beast posted video of those comments. Mulvaney himself had more positive words on Friday, tweeting, \"This is a tremendous honor. I look forward to working with the President and the entire team.

Specifically, the North is warning of \"surgical strikes at any time\" and a \"precision nuclear striking tool\" that will seek to \"advance our long-cherished wish for national reunification,\" reports the AP. The US-China deal is aimed at punishing Pyongyang over February\\'s nuclear test, in a joint deal that heads to the UN Security Council today. In addition to new sanctions—whose specifics aren\\'t yet known—the planned resolution enforces current ones, the Wall Street Journal reports. Right now, sanctions include a ban on ballistic missile and nuclear tests and a ban on the import of arms and luxury goods; some in the country face financial and travel restrictions, and the new measures could expand them. China was expected, however, to refuse an oil embargo, believing that such a blow to the North Korean economy could bring refugees to China.

Per the AP, newspaper publisher John Henry and editor Brian McGrory announced Friday an independent review found Cullen likely fabricated some anecdotes he shared in interviews after the bombing, which killed three people and injured hundreds more. The review also noted an uncorrected error in one of Cullen\\'s marathon bombing columns but didn\\'t find signs of fabrication in other works. Cullen, who was part of the Globe team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2014, didn\\'t immediately comment, but Henry and McGrory say he has apologized. Cullen has been on paid leave since April, when Boston sports radio station WEEI noted inconsistencies in Cullen\\'s work and the paper launched its investigation. Per the New York Times, Cullen described in an interview the tale of a firefighter he claimed to have spoken with. He said the firefighter described rescuing a 7-year-old girl whose lower leg had been blown off. However, the firefighter denied having ever spoken to Cullen. The Times also says Cullen, while speaking on a panel in 2013, claimed he witnessed a firefighter outside a bar on the phone with a fellow firefighter, who was apparently traumatized by the bombing, to come out for the night.

Three of the men are brothers from Chechnya, one of whom has been found guilty of the shooting itself, which NBC News reports took place \"execution-style\" in the elevator of her apartment building. The other two brothers were found guilty of tracking Politkovskaya and acting as getaway drivers, and their uncle and a retired police officer were found to have organized and prepared for the murder, respectively.

Another ex-cop was convicted of supplying the murder weapon last year, the BBC reports. The defendants\\' lawyers plan to appeal the convictions, Reuters reports. Politkovskaya’s family is disappointed that it\\'s still not clear who ordered the killing, saying in a statement that the men convicted \"are only a few of the people who should be brought to justice.\" Though an investigation into the murder continues, critics suggest the mastermind will never be found because, as Reuters puts it, \"the trail could lead too close to the government\"—Politkovskaya\\'s work angered quite a few important people.\\n',\n",

Caretaker prime minister Jose Socrates told the nation that the decision to seek a bailout was \"a last resort\" as interest rates on its short-term debt skyrocket, reports the Guardian. Analysts believe the bailout will cost the EU some $114 billion. Portugal, which will have to commit to an economic adjustment program in exchange for the funds, joins Ireland and Greece on the eurozone\\'s casualty list.

A report from the Government Accountability Office finds US government agencies spend $60 billion a year operating and maintaining outdated systems—three times more than is spent on upgrades, per CNN. One such system: the Pentagon\\'s IBM Series-1 computer which uses 8-inch floppy disks \"in a legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the nation\\'s nuclear forces,\" including intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombers. For youngsters, the big floppy disks were the precursor to the 3.5-inch ones, before the CD came around. \"This system remains in use because, in short, it still works,\" a Pentagon rep tells the AFP, per the BBC, which notes you\\'d need 130,000 8-inch floppy disks to get the storage capacity of a 32GB memory stick. \"However, to address obsolescence concerns, the floppy drives are scheduled to be replaced with secure digital devices by the end of 2017,\" the rep says.

Hundreds more cases are reported throughout Europe. The source: Germany blames cucumbers from Spain, specifically the Almeria and Malaga regions. A third batch from the Netherlands or Denmark is under investigation. Spain angrily denies being the source, and EU officials say the vegetables could have become tainted anywhere along the supply chain.

The results of an AP poll released last week show that nearly 60% of teens in the US have taken social media breaks—most of the time voluntary ones that last at least a week. Now researchers at the University of South Wales have presented findings to the British Psychological Society that suggest even what are perceived to be straightforward perks of social media—such as getting attention via likes—may not exactly elevate the end user\\'s mood. \"Although this is just a relatively small-scale study, the results indicate that the ways we interact with social media can affect how we feel, and not always positively,\" one researcher says. To test this, the team reports in a Science Daily news release that it recruited 340 participants on Twitter and Facebook to complete personality questionnaires and then agree or disagree with 25 statements. Key findings include that people who go out of their way to rack up more likes tend to have low self-esteem and be less trusting of others, and that those likes don\\'t actually lift their mood or how they see themselves. Previous research has looked not at more likes, but at more time, reports Medical Daily. It cites a study published in 2016 that surveyed 19- to 32-year-olds and found \"individuals in the highest quartile of [social media] site visits per week ... had significantly increased odds of depression.\" (Young people average at least an hour a day on social media.)\\n',\n",

Ki'ari underwent emergency surgery to clear scar tissue on her windpipe so she could breathe; after the tracheotomy, she continued to have difficulty breathing (requiring two trips to the ER) and also talking. She had a doctor's appointment set for Friday to be checked. But on Sunday night, she told her mother's boyfriend she was struggling to breathe; she lost consciousness within minutes and was pronounced dead about an hour later, at 12:15am Monday, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. The Medical Examiner's Office is still determining Ki'ari's cause of death, and Florida's Department of Children and Families is investigating the incident. There have been at least 10 other DCF cases related to the family since 2008, the Palm Beach Post reports, five of them involving alleged domestic violence between Ki'ari's mother and her boyfriend; it's not clear whether the boyfriend who called 911 after Ki'ari lost consciousness is the same one from those reports.

In a paper published in Science today, researchers detail how they examined the blood of more than 750 children in Tanzania. They found that about 6% of those children had an antibody against one of the disease\\'s key proteins, and that those children didn\\'t suffer from severe malaria. Researchers think they can make a vaccine patterned on their blood, Paul Rodgers at Forbes explains. Until now, most malaria vaccines have focused on keeping the disease out of the red blood cells it reproduces in. But this antibody is unique in that it instead attacks the protein that allows the parasite to escape the cells. \"We\\'re sort of trapping the parasite in the burning house,\" says co-lead author Jonathan Kurtis—who suffered his own bout of malaria while studying in Kenya while in college, NPR reports.

Josie Cunningham, dubbed \"Britain\\'s most hated woman,\" now says she\\'s \"ashamed\" of her plans to offer tickets to the birth at around $66,000 a pop and charge Skype viewers $330 to watch via livestream, reports the Daily Mirror. At least four people had paid an apparently reduced price of $15,000 each per ticket, according to the Daily News. Why else don\\'t the Brits like her? She had a breast augmentation paid for by the public health system, and told the Mirror earlier this year that she was being considered for Big Brother and would abort her baby if it would help her chances. Then she apparently got upset upon learning that her baby would be another boy (she already has two sons). So she coped by drinking and smoking, until doctors said last week that the baby will actually be a girl. \"I have been such a silly girl and have lots of regrets,\" Cunningham says. \"I can see that now I know I am going to have a daughter.\"\\n',\n",

One of the biggest shockers from the event: Research in Motion is scrapping its name, and will now be known simply as BlackBerry. Other developments: CEO Thorsten Heins underscored the \"heartfelt and brutal honesty\" BlackBerry had to go through to get to this day, reports Forbes. It\\'s been a long haul for the phone, which is debuting nearly a year late. Heins showcased two phones: the Z10, which has a full 4.2-inch touchscreen, and the Q10, which has a traditional keyboard set below a smaller touchscreen. Heins said the Q10 was created for customers \"that said we just have to have a physical keyboarding experience,\" reports USA Today.

First up was BlackBerry Hub, the central interface for the Z10. It has a tiled layout not unlike Microsoft\\'s latest Windows iteration. BlackBerry software honcho Vivek Bhardwaj also showed off BlackBerry Peek, the phone\\'s notification system, which allows users to check emails and calendars without leaving the app they\\'re using. Bhardwaj also discussed the hotly anticipated BlackBerry Balance feature, which aims to reinstate BlackBerry\\'s dominance among business users. It allows users to maintain a personal profile on the phone, while a company can access the phone\\'s professional profile. As for hardware, BlackBerry\\'s camera now allows for face-to-face messaging. The Z10 will be available in black and white, and ZDNet notes prices will hover around $149 for a three-month contract, depending on the carrier.

Alpha House was created by Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau, who also writes the series about four Republican senators living together. The pilot (which features cameos by Bill Murray and Stephen Colbert) went online a month ago, along with 13 others, and Amazon looked at customer feedback to determine which to pick up for a full season. Alpha House was one of just two comedy pilots to make the cut. The Washington Post describes Alpha House as \"political satire\" in which the senators, played by John Goodman, Mark Consuelos, Clark Johnson, and Matt Malloy \"live like frat brothers.\" It was inspired by a real Capitol Hill property in which Democratic senators have lived over the years, and it\\'s been kicking around in Trudeau\\'s brain since 2008.

As Kyodo News reports, the princess\\' family is worried about a money issue swirling around the family of her potential future husband, Kei Komuro. It seems that Komuro\\'s mother used money from a former romantic partner to pay for her son\\'s educational expenses. Now there\\'s apparently a rift between the two former lovers about repayment, and Mako\\'s parents, Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko, want it publicly cleared up before any nuptials take place, according to Japanese media reports. This isn\\'t the first sign of trouble for the impending nuptials. The couple initially announced plans to marry in November 2017, but abruptly postponed the wedding until 2020 and explained that they were rushing things. And when New York\\'s Fordham University announced that the princess\\' \"fiance\" would be attending law school there, the Japanese royal family chafed at the term \"fiance\" as the couple\\'s engagement ceremony has not taken place, prompting the school to issue a new release without it. Assuming Princess Mako goes through with the wedding, she will have to renounce her royal status, though the Guardian notes that the couple would get nearly $1 million from the government to help with that transition.

CBS Philly reports that administrators shut off Butera\\'s microphone after he veered off his pre-approved script to condemn what he called the \"authoritative attitude\" of some of the school\\'s faculty and staff, an attitude, he said, that \"prevents students from developing as true leaders. Hopefully, this will change.\" At which point his mic went silent. The Wilkes-Barre Citizens\\' Voice quotes a statement from principal Jon Pollard in which he explains he felt obligated to stop Butera\\'s speech in order to \"ensure the remainder of [it] was not demeaning or derogatory to his classmates, the underclassmen, faculty, staff or administration.\" The Washington Post talks to a friend of Butera\\'s who says Butera was frustrated by having numerous ideas turned down by Pollard during his four years as class president. (Other off-script lines from Butera: \"At our school, the title of class president can more accurately be class party planner.

While Apple started the trend of smartphones with large touchscreens, its 3.5-inch screen has started to look diminutive next to offerings like Samsung\\'s Galaxy Nexus\\' 4.65 inches. But MacRumors is dubious about the report, noting that numerous previous whispers put the new screen at 4 inches, and that many companies making iPhone cases seem to be betting on that. One source with a good track record said the new iPhone would have a longer, 4-inch display and an aluminum casing, but was \"still in the engineering phase, not early production.\" Apple Insider is also dubious of the second quarter launch date; previous reports have always put it in September or October.\\n',\n",

According to a study published Monday in Heart, people who feel lonely or are socially isolated have a 29% increase in risk of coronary heart disease and a 32% increase in risk of stroke. While previous studies have shown a person\\'s general health is influenced by their social relationships, this may be the first to show \"deficiencies in social relationships\" are no good for your heart. Medical Daily reports researchers looked at 23 studies—a total of 181,000 people—about loneliness, social isolation, and health to come to their conclusion. The Guardian notes that coronary heart disease and strokes are the two leading causes of death in first-world countries. And the new study shows loneliness and social isolation are bigger risk factors for those problems than either work stress or general anxiety. “People have tended to focus from a policy point of view at targeting lonely people to make them more connected,” the New York Times quotes study co-author Nicole Valtorta as saying. “Our study shows that if this is a risk factor, then we should be trying to prevent the risk factor in the first place.” The research is especially important as other studies show social isolation growing and young people feeling more lonely than ever before.

Finally, surgeons at the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre decided they had no choice and performed what is believed to be the world\\'s first transplant from an HIV-positive donor, per a university release. The surgery itself went well, and, more significantly, the child is HIV negative one year later. It\\'s too early to say whether that will hold true permanently, but the news is being hailed as a potentially big development, especially in countries such as South Africa where HIV is prevalent. \"This operation could be a game changer for South Africa,\" write three officials from the University of Witwatersrand (affiliated with the hospital) in the Conversation. \"The country has a large pool of virally suppressed HIV-positive people who have previously not been considered for living liver donation.\" The piece details the ethical quandaries the hospital faced, including whether it would be right to deny the mother a chance to save her baby, even with the risk of HIV infection. The story is drawing international attention, and in the US, Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health says doctors made the right choice—even if the child had emerged with HIV. \"If it is a choice between death and living reasonably well with a treatable infection, I think they made a quite reasonable choice,\" he tells the AP.

Scientists think that bugs and plants have survived Antarctica\\'s ice ages only because they found warmth near live volcanoes, reports AFP.

The location of the nudist area has yet to be determined, but Deputy Mayor Bruno Julliard—a supporter—said the intention is to prevent any disruption of \"public order\" and suggested two wooded areas, the westside Bois de Boulogne or eastside Bois de Vincennes. France is famous for its nude beaches, and proponents—including the mayor—say that nudists should have a place within the capital city.

The super PACs in question are only a week old, and it\\'s unprecedented to have raised so much so quickly. So who\\'s behind the money? The New York Times identifies the main player as a \"reclusive Long Islander\" named Robert Mercer. Mercer began his career at IBM but now runs a hedge fund called Renaissance Technologies, and like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson, he is taking advantage of the Citizens United case that loosened restrictions on wealthy donors. He\\'s \"a very low-profile guy, but he’s becoming a bigger and bigger player,” says one campaign finance expert. And his backing of Cruz “sends the message to other donors that Cruz is a serious guy,” which in turn encourages other donors. The Times notes that Mercer\\'s hedge fund is under investigation by the IRS, an agency that Cruz would love to abolish. A previous profile of Mercer at Bloomberg describes him as \"one of the most powerful men in Republican politics that nobody is talking about.\"\\n',\n",

Armed with a gun, Sykes, 23, busted into the back door of Newport\\'s Seasons Pizza in 2010 but eventually got tackled by employees. In a federal civil complaint, filed without an attorney, Sykes admits, \"I committed a robbery at Seasons Pizza\" but now alleges that the workers \"unnecessary\" roughed him up during that robbery, the News Journal reports. He wants $260,000 from the pizzeria, its employees, and Delaware State Police for his troubles.

The rapper unveiled both his new album—The Life of Pablo—and clothing line—Yeezus Season 3—during an event at Madison Square Gardens in New York City. The whole thing was livestreamed around the world. And, as with most things having to do with Kanye West, it was all the Internet was talking about. Here are five things you need to know about Kanye\\'s day: It was huge. The Verge reports more than 20 million tried to watch the stream of the nearly two-hour event at one time. \"The early viewership numbers are insane…There aren\\'t many other musicians who could pull this off.\" Lamar Odom was there. It was the former NBA player\\'s first public appearance since nearly dying following an overdose at a Nevada brothel in October, according to People. Odom continues to recover from his coma and sat with estranged wife Khloé Kardashian after entering with the rest of West\\'s family. Kanye made a video game. The Verge reports it\\'s called Only One and depicts his late mother \"traveling through the gates of heaven,\" apparently alternating between her own set of wings and a pegasus. West says a lot of people turned down his pitch for the game. Martin Shkreli tried to steal his thunder. The legally troubled \"pharma bro\" offered West $10 million for The Life of Pablo, hoping to delay or prevent its release to the public, according to the New York Times. \"Instead of releasing this product for your millions of fans, I ask you to sell this recording solely to me,\" Shkreli tweeted. \"I believe you (and your partners) will find this financial arrangement more attractive than your current course of action.\" Kanye is still super quotable.

Set in royally screwed-up Los Angeles (home to the masses) and an idyllic space station in the clouds (home to the rich) circa 2154, this flick from Neill Blomkamp (District 9) has both the compelling themes and action-packed fight scenes to make it a summer blockbuster. So is it one? Critics are split. The action sequences, complete with \"futuristic CGI flying machines\" are impressive, but it\\'s \"Blomkamp\\'s critique of a society riven by class and racial differences\" that sets it apart, Soren Anderson writes for the Seattle Times. \"Few mainstream moviemakers have painted as sprawling and densely detailed a portrait of humanity in extremis as Blomkamp does here.\" But at the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan\\'s high hopes were dashed. \"Elysium is no promised land.\" Though Matt Damon is great as always and the visuals are equally as impressive, \"the film doesn\\'t feel as singular as we would have hoped.\" District 9 did a much better job of connecting genre (sci-fi) and theme (\"socio-political concerns\"). Even with the talented Damon along for the ride, Dana Stephens at Slate writes Elysium \"does a little, sometimes shockingly little, with a lot ... Blomkamp proceeds to spend the last two-thirds of his film crashing spaceships into lawns, or staging high-tech fistfights. It’s a waste of a perfectly good dystopia.\" But over at the Philadelphia Inquirer, Steven Rea sees things differently. \"Among the slew of recent futuristic hell-in-a-hand-basket spectacles, Elysium takes the cake.\" Sure, it can be a little generic at times—\"haven\\'t we just seen all this head-bashing, hanging-from-catwalks, mixed-martial-arts mayhem in The Wolverine and Iron Man 3?—but \"as summer movie sci-fi extravaganzas go, Elysium is easily the best thing out there right now.\"\\n',\n",

Well, it turns out the sound of an actual ticking clock can speed up your reproductive timing, making you want to have babies earlier, according to a new study published in Springer\\'s journal Human Nature. Researchers asked men and women questions about their reproductive attitudes—things like when they\\'d like to marry and have kids and how much they\\'d be willing to alter their \"requirements\" for a mate in order to start a family earlier—and they found that the sound of a ticking clock influenced women\\'s answers, possibly because it made them think about the passage of time. \"The very subtle sound prime of a ticking clock changed the timing with which women sought to have children and the traits they sought in potential partners—both central aspects of women’s mating-related psychology,\" says one of the lead researchers. Women who grew up in lower socioeconomic areas were particularly affected, wanting to get married and start families even earlier—and placing a lower priority on their mate\\'s status and earning potential—than women who were raised with more resources. Not surprisingly, men, who can typically father children well into their later years, were not affected by the clock sound. As Jesse Singal notes in New York, \"all sorts of subtle cues can affect how people answer questions,\" but this result is still \"kinda weird.\" (Click to read about why some doctors don\\'t think freezing your eggs is a good idea.)\\n',\n",

Castro\\'s reasoning: \"If the Yanks were stupid enough to use drugs that came from Colombia, not only was that not his problem ... it served his revolutionary objectives in the sense that it corrupted and destabilized American society,\" the book reads. Sanchez also accuses Castro of covering up his involvement by engineering sham trials that led to the deaths of two devoted officers, including Abrantes; this fueled the alcoholism of brother Raul, who feared he would be next.

The stat does represent a sort of improvement: The Tribune reports that around this time last year, those numbers were 53 and nine, respectively. And the Atlantic Wire notes that a deadlier weekend has already occurred in 2013: January closed with eight deaths. The youngest victim, 16-year-old Kevin Rivera, apparently tried to flee from a gunman on a bicycle late Saturday. The dead teen's family was just two weeks away from a move from their sometimes dangerous Hermosa neighborhood.\\n\",\n",

Reuters reports on the new evidence that brought them to that conclusion: a silver-colored pistol prosecutor Ricardo Jimenez says Sebastian Woodroffe purchased in early April. They were told by a witness that the pistol tumbled out of the 41-year-old\\'s backpack when locals, angry over Olivia Arevalo\\'s death, grabbed him; he was subsequently lynched. Jimenez says no weapon has been found, but \"he is the main suspect.\" As for a motive, Jimenez says Arevalo\\'s son owed Woodroffe nearly $4,500, though Jimenez told the BBC Arevalo\\'s family claims Woodroffe became enraged when Arevalo wouldn\\'t conduct an ayahuasca ceremony for him. Meanwhile, the AP reports Peru\\'s attorney general has ordered two suspects be arrested in connection with Woodroffe\\'s death. It adds forensic experts are examining the Canadian\\'s remains to see if there is any evidence of his shooting Arevalo. (This ayahuasca ceremony ended in death in 2015.)\\n',\n",

The lawsuit filed Thursday against an anti-abortion group called the Center for Medical Progress accuses the group of committing fraud and breaking racketeering laws to obtain videos of Planned Parenthood employees discussing the transfer of organs from aborted fetuses, Reuters reports. The lawsuit states that the group\\'s activities lasted years and involved the use of fake government IDs, the creation of a fake company, and \"large-scale illegal taping\" as part of an effort to \"demonize Planned Parenthood.\" \"The people behind this fraud lied and broke the law in order to spread malicious lies,\" Planned Parenthood executive vice president Dawn Laguens tells the AP. \"This lawsuit exposes the elaborate, illegal conspiracy designed to block women\\'s access to safe and legal abortion.\" She says no Planned Parenthood staff were involved in any wrongdoing. \"My response is: Game on,\" Center for Medical Progress founder David Daleiden tells BuzzFeed, adding that he is looking forward to \"taking the depositions of all the Planned Parenthood CEOs\" that he claims profited from tissue sales. The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, and Planned Parenthood lawyer Beth Parker tells the AP that the amount will include the cost of extra security for clinics.\\n',\n",

A bill ending the country\\'s 95-year prohibition on cannabis passed Canada\\'s Senate by a vote of 52 to 29, CTV reports. After royal assent is granted—which could happen as soon as Wednesday—the government will set a date for the new law, Bill C-45, to come into force. The bill grants provinces a \"buffer period\" of eight to 12 weeks to prepare for legal marijuana sales, meaning Canadians over 18 could be able to buy legal pot as soon as September, the CBC reports. Canadians will also be allowed to grow small amounts of pot for recreational use. Independent Sen. Tony Dean, the bill\\'s Senate sponsor, said he was feeling \"great,\" Global News reports. \"We\\'ve just witnessed a historic vote for Canada. The end of 90 years of prohibition,\" he said. He added that it is now time to start addressing the harms of cannabis and the $7 billion illegal market, an approach echoed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \"It’s been too easy for our kids to get marijuana - and for criminals to reap the profits,\" he tweeted. \"Today, we change that.\" The bill makes Canada only the second country, after Uruguay, to legalize recreational use of cannabis nationwide, reports the BBC. (Canadian pot growers started ramping up production last year.)\\n',\n",
       " '– North Korea carried out what it said is the demolition of its nuclear test site Thursday, setting off a series of explosions over several hours in the presence of foreign journalists. The explosions at the nuclear test site deep in the mountains of the North\\'s sparsely populated northeast were centered on three tunnels into the underground site and a number of observation towers in the surrounding area, reports the AP. The planned closing was previously announced by Kim Jong Un ahead of his planned summit with President Trump next month. Sky News correspondent Tom Cheshire was on hand, and described it thusly: \"We hiked up into the mountains and watched the detonation from about 500 meters away. ... There was a huge explosion, you could feel it. Dust came at you, the heat came at you. It was extremely loud.\" The North\\'s decision to close the Punggye-ri nuclear test site has generally been seen as a welcome gesture by Kim to set a positive tone ahead of the summit. Even so, it is not an irreversible move and would need to be followed by many more significant measures to meet Trump\\'s demands for real denuclearization. By bringing in the foreign media, mainly television networks, the North is apparently hoping to have images of the closing—including explosions to collapse tunnel entrances—broadcast around the world. The group included an AP television crew. The North did not invite international inspectors to the ceremony, which limits its value as a serious concession. (Pyongyang is apparently all over the place on Thursday.)\\n',\n",

The video follows the same pattern as the previous three, in which an Islamic State fighter rants against the West. At the end of the video, the militant threatens an American aid worker who has been identified as Peter Kassig, a former US Army veteran who became a volunteer in the Mideast. \"Obama, you have started your aerial bombard of Shams (Syria), which keep on striking our people, so it is only right that we strike the next of your people,\" says the militant.

       " '– A federal judge in Hawaii blocked President Trump\\'s revised travel ban just hours before it was set to go into effect across the country, the Washington Post reports. Hawaii had filed a lawsuit over the new executive order, which halted visas for citizens from six Muslim-majority nations for 90 days and stopped new refugees for 120 days, claiming it hurts tourism, business, and universities and would keep people from those six countries from visiting family in Hawaii. The state alleged the order, which also cuts the number of refugees allowed in the US next year in half, was essentially a Muslim ban. US District Judge Derrick Watson froze the order Wednesday, saying Hawaii has a \"strong likelihood of success on their claim,\" according to Politico. More than six states are currently trying to halt the new travel ban, the AP reports. Arguments against it were also scheduled to be heard in Maryland and Washington state on Wednesday. Trump issued the revised travel ban after his first attempt was blocked by a federal judge in Washington state. Justice Department lawyers defending the new executive order said the ban was well within the president\\'s power and claimed its potential harms were only speculation.\\n',\n",
       " '– They didn\\'t set out to do a study on divorce, but two University of Washington researchers poring over a range of sociological data saw such a clear pattern emerge that they\\'ve ended up with one: It turns out that that married couples divorce most often in March and August. When the researchers plotted the data from 2001 to 2015, the divorce spike in those two months was both striking and consistent, they write in a press release. And while that data comes exclusively from Washington state, it seems to apply nationwide. The researchers followed up with a look at data from Ohio, Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona, and found the same pattern. So what\\'s going on? They think winter holidays and summer vacations are a big factor. These are both \"culturally sacred times for families,\" says associate sociology professor Julie Brines, per the UW release. That is, couples may be reluctant to split around Christmas, or just ahead of an annual vacation, and instead view those times instead as an opportunity to mend a troubled relationship. \"One last shot,\" as Brines puts it, per the Atlantic. If they fail, the added stress of the holidays or the tight quarters of a vacation then push the couple toward divorce. The delay from post-holidays to March in the divorce filings may be because the holidays put such a heavy dent in the wallet, notes Bustle. That\\'s less of an issue in the summer, and the researchers speculate that, for couples with kids, the start of school may actually speed things along. (This woman was selling her wedding dress to pay for her divorce, complete with \"stench of betrayal.\")\\n',\n",
       " '– Human radiologists, look out. Pigeons turn out to be expert mammogram readers after very little training, at least according to a study published this week in PLoS ONE. Using 16 pigeons in a chamber with a touchscreen, scientists trained them to peck at one of two colored buttons to correspond with the type of image they were being shown; if they got it right, they got food. It turns out that those beady little eyes picked up patterns showing malignant versus benign breast tissue very well and very fast. At first, as they were trained for what to spot, they were right 50% of the time. \"In some sense, the pigeon and the person are starting at the same place,\" says one researcher, experimental psychologist Edward Wasserman. \"They\\'re equally naive.\" But a mere two weeks into the experiment the pigeons were identifying the images correctly 85% of the time, reports the Washington Post. What\\'s more, the birds were able to take what they\\'d learned from the first, familiar set of slides and apply it to new images they\\'d never seen before, boasting a success rate that was just a few percentage points lower. And they performed even better as a flock than individually—with a success rate maxing out at 99% when required to \"vote\" as a group, reports Gizmodo. It\\'s more likely that robots, not pigeons, will be the ones to take the place of humans someday. But Wasserman hopes pigeons will be taken more seriously and studied more closely. \"The pigeon has kind of a bum rap,\" he says. \"Humans are not the only intelligent animals walking and swimming and flying on Earth.\" It\\'s also helpful, he tells Discover, that they\\'re \"workaholics.\" (Pigeons have a biological GPS.)\\n',\n",

Andrew Cuomo, who announced he\\'s putting emergency measures into place to go after wage theft and health hazards in the industry, the AP reports. In a statement cited by the Times, Cuomo said he\\'s setting up a task force, effective immediately, to check salons individually, come up with mandates to protect workers from possibly dangerous chemicals wafting around their salons, and conduct a six-language educational campaign to let workers know this kind of debasement isn\\'t OK. \"We will not stand idly by as workers are deprived of their hard-earned wages and robbed of their most basic rights,\" Cuomo said in the statement. Several government agencies, including the Health Department, were spurred into action last week after the two-part Times article ran. Rules going into effect ASAP include publicly posted signage (in different languages) in salons listing workers\\' rights, a requirement that manicurists wear gloves and masks, and a mandate that all salons are bonded so employees can recoup wages if it\\'s found they\\'ve been denied rightful earnings, per the Times. Cuomo\\'s office says the task force agencies won\\'t probe workers\\' immigration status. Creating the emergency plan allowed Cuomo to skirt red tape. \"The article highlighted a significant problem in New York State,\" the governor\\'s general counsel tells the Times. “We cannot wait to address the problem.\" (What could help protect workers: more \"green\" salons.)\\n',\n",

Mike Timon, angry over his treatment by the airline, tells the San Diego Union-Tribune that he was banned for touching the female flight attendant on the buttocks as he sat in first class on a flight from Oregon to San Diego on Dec. 26. Timon says he touched the woman politely on her back to get her attention so he could order a drink. Timon, who owns a medical equipment company and frequently flies first class, said that when no drink came, he pressed his call button, and a male flight attendant came to say he had been cut off. Timon said he had only had a single drink and was sober. He says his gesture was misunderstood as sexual harassment, and he was met by police who escorted him off the plane. Police took statements from Timon and others but there was no further action. \"For me to be accused of this, and for me to be escorted off the plane by police? This is it. I\\'m blowing up,\" Timon says. \"It\\'s unnecessary. It\\'s discrimination toward me.\" He says widespread concern over sexual harassment has hurt men like him. \"It\\'s out of control and I am pissed,\" he says. Alaska spokeswoman Ann Johnson confirmed that Timon cannot fly on the airline pending the outcome of an investigation but said she could not provide specifics about his case, the AP reports. \"Alaska Airlines will not tolerate any type of sexual misconduct that creates an unsafe environment for our guests and crew members and we are fully committed to do our part to address this serious issue,\" Johnson said.\\n',\n",

Think we\\'re talking a third-world sweatshop? It\\'s what\\'s happening right now on US tobacco farms, Human Rights Watch alleges in a report today. The group spoke to 141 tobacco farm workers aged 7 to 17, and found that many came in bare-skin contact with tobacco plants. That can cause acute nicotine poisoning—and indeed, 66% of those polled reported symptoms consistent with that, including dizziness, nausea, and headaches. \"On the first day when I was working [chemicals] got on my face a lot and I didn\\'t know until I got home later that my face was burning,\" one 13-year-old worker tells the BBC. US labor laws protecting child laborers have exceptions for agricultural jobs, the group explains, allowing children of any age to work the fields, and those 12 and older to work unlimited hours. An attempt to change that for tobacco farms died in 2012. HRW shared its findings with tobacco producers, and most expressed concern.

It will also keep up its current practice of spending $40 billion a month on mortgage bonds, the AP reports, bringing its total monthly spending to $85 billion, and growing its now almost $3 trillion portfolio. This is a \"historic move\" that \"will change how we think about Fed policy, yet again,\" writes Sudeep Reddy at the Wall Street Journal. Instead of pegging its targets to specific time frames, the Fed is now tying its policies to specific economic outcomes. The policy is sometimes referred to as the \"Evans rule,\" because Chicago Fed President Charles Evans has been pushing for it for months. The Fed is also sending a strong, loud signal that it\\'s willing to allow inflation to rise if that\\'s what it takes to reduce unemployment.\\n',\n",

Trustees say they were given the names of two finalists the day before the first was to be interviewed, and they spent only 75 minutes interviewing Hermann, reports the Star-Ledger. \"It was not enough time,\" says one. \"Let’s not present this as any kind of exemplary process. Subsequent events have proven otherwise.” The search leaders tried via email to smooth things over, telling trustees, \"You all had the opportunity to examine Julie’s credentials, to spend some time with her when she was on campus. As you know, there was strong support for Julie.\" That prompted a string of emails that the lone student on the search committee likened to \"a professional catfight in my email inbox.\" Adding insult to injury, Rutgers paid an executive search company $70,000 to vet finalists for the job, notes the New York Times; now, the school is also paying a crisis-management company $150,000 to deal with the scandals\\' fallout.\\n',\n",
       " '– Scientists have observed a behavior never before seen in killer whales, and it makes for a grim discovery. Following strange calls from orcas off the northeastern coast of British Columbia\\'s Vancouver Island in December, researchers observed the first known case of infanticide among the whales. After tracking down the orcas and hearing a ruckus in the water, the scientists spotted a male orca with a newborn calf in its mouth, being chased by the calf\\'s mother and other members of its family. As the male\\'s mother attempted to intervene, the calf\\'s mother \"hit the male so hard that ... his blubber was shaking on his body and you could see blood flying through the air,\" ecologist Jared Towers tells the CBC. \"We were really quite horrified and fascinated.\" The male still didn\\'t let go of the calf, which had died by that point, according to Newsweek. Researchers, describing the case in Scientific Reports, say the male orca likely killed the calf so the male orca could mate with the infant\\'s mother. In other mammals, infanticide \"forces the infant\\'s mom into a fertile state much quicker,\" Towers says. He adds researchers previously thought female orcas were picky about mates, but this behavior suggests \"females don\\'t have a lot of choice when it comes to breeding.\" The CBC notes $9 million the Canadian government has dedicated to orca research may reveal more about the endangered species in time, as Washington state works on protection, per Time.

Curtis Dawkins' debut, The Graybar Hotel, was published in July by Scribner and details life behind bars in ways that have thrilled readers. Michigan's Department of Treasury is less enthused, however, and has filed a court complaint that asks that 90% of the convicted killer's reported $150,000 advance be given to the state as payment for the cost of his imprisonment. Michigan's attorney general reportedly filed the complaint, which states that Dawkins is not entitled to the money or to transfer any of it to his family, not long after his victim's brother complained publicly about the book deal, per the Guardian. Because he cannot afford an attorney, Dawkins is scheduled to defend himself in the case. Dawkins has in the past expressed remorse for the 2004 botched robbery that led to the murder of Thomas Bowman. The New York Times reports he intends to argue that the same law the attorney general says allows the state to keep the profits also stipulates that courts must consider a convict's obligation to provide for his children or spouse when deciding such cases. Michigan is one of some 40 states with laws on the books that allow the government to force inmates to pay for incarceration. According to the Times, Michigan collected $3.7 million from fewer than 300 of the state's 40,000 inmates. A hearing in Dawkins' case is scheduled for Feb. 26 in Kalamazoo.\\n\",\n",

Woodlawn hitchhiked back to New York at 16, where she was a go-go dancer, among other things: \"I was turning tricks, living off the streets and wondering when my next meal was coming,\" she wrote in her 1991 memoir. While performing in a friend\\'s musical in 1969, Woodlawn told a journalist that she was one of Warhol\\'s superstars, and though that wasn\\'t actually true at that point, her comment got his attention and led to what the Times refers to as Woodlawn\\'s \"underground stardom.\" Warhol\\'s filmmaking partner Paul Morrissey cast her in the 1970 film Trash as the girlfriend of a heroin addict, and the performance got good reviews. She went on to star alongside two other transgender actresses in Morrissey\\'s 1971 film Women in Revolt; both films were produced by Warhol. In 1972, Reed wrote the first lines of his now-classic song about Woodlawn at Warhol\\'s suggestion, the Washington Post reports: \"Holly came from Miami F-L-A / Hitchhiked her way across the USA / Plucked her eyebrows on the way / Shaved her legs and then he was a she / She says, \\'Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side.\\'\" She went on to do a few more films and perform as a cabaret artist, but by the end of the 1970s she was working at a Benihana in Miami.

Other \"insiders\" back him up, including one who says that the days-long \"dates\" include LiLo\\'s hotel and travel costs, food, jewelry, and \"other gifts.\" But no sex—or at least, not that anyone is saying. She\\'s supposedly been paid to be seen on the arm of a Southeast Asian prince and a rich Spanish-American painter. It\\'s far from the only troubling LiLo story bubbling up: A source also tells Us that last fall, Lindsay did $50,000 worth of damage to a fancy New York hotel room. \"Her suite had so many cigarette burns, they had to change all the carpets,\" the insider says. \"She is not allowed back at any W hotel in NYC, ever!\" And then, of course, there are Lohan\\'s legal problems. She could still be facing jail time for allegedly lying to police after her June car accident, but her longtime attorney Shawn Holley planned to make a plea deal involving rehab for Lindsay instead. But Lohan fired Holley as the attorney was on her way to court to make the deal Monday, TMZ reports. Even so, Holley entered a not-guilty plea on Lohan\\'s behalf yesterday, and the Atlantic Wire notes that the next hearing is set for Jan. 30.\\n',\n",
       " '– Good news for those trying to conceive: A new study suggests there\\'s no reason for you to continue lying down, immobile, after having sex. There\\'s a widespread belief that lying still after sex helps give the sperm time to get where they need to go, and the same belief has transferred over to women getting intra-uterine insemination (IUI), a fertility treatment in which sperm are injected directly into the uterus. \"There’s a lot of anxiety that after IUI if you stand up, everything will fall out,\" an expert from the University of Southampton tells New Scientist. Two studies have found that resting in bed for 15 minutes after getting IUI did increase success rates, but they were small studies. The new, larger study out of Amsterdam\\'s VU University Medical Center disputes that belief. Researchers looked at 479 women getting IUI, most of whom got multiple rounds; they collected information on nearly 2,000 cycles overall. Women were randomly assigned to either get up and move immediately after treatment or stay on bed rest for 15 minutes before moving. Of the cycles incorporating bed rest, 32% resulted in pregnancy—while 40% of the cycles after which the women immediately moved resulted in pregnancy. \"In our opinion,\" says the lead researcher in a press release, \"immobilization after IUI has no positive effect on pregnancy rates, and there is no reason why patients should stay immobilized after treatment.\" She would not \"generalize\" the results to give advice to couples attempting to get pregnant via traditional intercourse, but the Southampton expert thinks the study likely applies there, too. (This woman became pregnant after her doctor said she couldn\\'t, and now she\\'s suing.)\\n',\n",

       " '– If President Trump and former attorney Michael Cohen weren\\'t already on the outs, the revelation that Cohen secretly recorded at least one of their phone conversations has cinched it. The president took to Twitter Saturday morning to express his displeasure and to suggest that Cohen might have broken the law. The FBI seized the recording during its raid on Cohen\\'s office earlier this year, but the tape only came to light this week. On Saturday, Trump reiterated he wasn\\'t happy about that April raid, either. \"Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of,\" he wrote. \"Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!\" The tape is of a phone conversation Cohen had with Trump shortly before the election in which they discuss a possible payment regarding former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal, who planned to go public with allegations of an affair. Presidential attorney Rudy Guiliani has heard the tape, and he says it is not legally damaging to Trump. Plus, no payment was ever made, he says. Prosecutors have been looking into the McDougal controversy—the National Enquirer, owned by a Trump ally, eventually paid her $150,000 but then killed the story—to see whether any campaign finance laws were violated. Meanwhile, Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti tells MSNBC that he knows \"for a fact\" more Cohen-Trump tapes exist and should be made public, reports the Hill.\\n',\n",

The 20-year-old climbed into the tank of an outdoor toilet Friday after his friend dropped his cellphone into it, AFP reports. According to VG, the friends decided Larsen was the only one skinny enough to get into the toilet and retrieve the phone. \"Slim enough to get into it, but not slim enough to get out,\" Larsen clarifies. He found himself standing thigh-deep in excrement—the toilet is only emptied once per year—and unable to climb out. Larsen was, understandably, vomiting; in addition to the human waste, he says there were animals crawling on him. After an hour of Larsen trying to escape the poo-poo prison, his friends called the local fire department. Firefighters quickly cut Larsen out of the toilet using a chainsaw. A spokesperson for the department notes \"it was pretty full down there.\" Larsen was disinfected and treated for bruising on his arms, and he also says he received some animal bites, per the Sun. \"It was disgusting as hell. The worst thing I have ever experienced,\" Larsen tells VG. \"I will never enter a toilet again.\" And he didn\\'t even get the phone, according to AFP. (That classic summertime pool smell?

       " '– Conservative pastors in Houston complain that the city is trampling on religious freedoms in the battle over a controversial equal-rights ordinance introduced earlier this year. The city\\'s lawyers have subpoenaed several high-profile pastors opposed to the law, seeking, among other things, \"all speeches, presentations, or sermons\" related to the law, homosexuality, and openly gay Mayor Annise Parker, reports the Houston Chronicle. The law\\'s opponents are suing the city, claiming that it was wrong to determine that an effort to force a repeal referendum didn\\'t gather enough signatures. Plaintiffs call the move \"harassment\" and a violation of First Amendment rights. \"For a city government to step into churches and ask pastors to turn in sermons, it\\'s gone too far. This is not what America, the nation is about,\" one pastor who received a subpoena tells KTRK. But a city attorney says that since some of the signatures on the repeal petition were gathered at churches, the sermons are part of the case. \"If they choose to do this inside the church, choose to do this from the pulpit, then they open the door to the questions being asked,\" he says.\\n',\n",
       " '– A double-amputee Army veteran who was called an \"adventure seeker\" and \"strong-willed man\" by friends died Wednesday in the Chesapeake Bay while paddleboarding, NPR and the Washington Post report. Cody Iorns, 25, pushed off land near Annapolis, Md., around 6pm Wednesday with three other paddlers, but rough conditions—including 5-foot-waves and 25mph wind gusts—soon caused Iorns to fall behind his friends. \"They all of a sudden looked back and noticed that Cody had fallen from his paddleboard and was face down in the water,\" Candy Thomson, a rep for the Maryland Natural Resources Police, tells NPR. The others pulled Iorns, whose life jacket hadn\\'t inflated, back onto his board and administered CPR, which medics took over when they arrived on the scene, but it was too late. Iorns was pronounced dead at Anne Arundel Medical Center; the state medical examiner said the cause of death was accidental drowning. The Capital Gazette notes Iorns\\' death brings the number of boat-related fatalities so far for 2018 to 10; last year by this time there had only been four. \"We\\'re on pace for one of the deadliest years boating-wise in Maryland,\" says MNRP Capt. Brian Rathgeb. The Annapolis paddleboard community, meanwhile, is mourning the loss of Iorns, a former Army medic who lost his arms after a 2015 motorcycle accident but had become an inspiration in the stand-up paddleboard community. His story had just been featured by National Geographic last year. \"He was our brother,\" paddleboard company Capital SUP Annapolis posted on Facebook. \"He was an inspiration to everyone on and off the water.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"– A controversial new paper may shed light on Gulf War syndrome, a collection of symptoms seen in veterans of the 1991 conflict: Chemical weapons could be to blame. The researchers assert that when US troops bombed chemical weapons depots in Iraq, the neurotoxin sarin was sent into the atmosphere then carried by the wind all the way to American encampments 300 miles to the south. From there, weather conditions may have driven the toxin downward, potentially exposing troops to it for several days. Troops were told that chemical weapons alarms that blared at the time were false alarms, the New York Times reports. The theory has been raised before; the new paper supports it using intelligence and weather reports. The researchers also noted a correlation between the number of times troops say they heard the alarm and the severity of their symptoms. Satellite images in the report show yellow gas over the US encampments, USA Today adds. Almost half of 700,000 Gulf War veterans have made claims for disability, with many citing symptoms whose cause remains mysterious. The Pentagon has maintained that the gas couldn't have traveled far enough to present a threat, and other experts have agreed.\\n\",\n",

And yes, they still smell bad,\" an archaeologist explains. The team stumbled on what appears to be a 14th-century communal toilet area in the medieval town of Odense, unearthing a number of medieval barrels filled with human waste. And in case you were wondering, the poop the barrels contained was in \"excellent condition,\" reports Discovery News, with the Copenhagen Post explaining that its \"putrid odor\" hadn\\'t diminished over the centuries. But it\\'s more than just stinky. It actually tells researchers a lot about how the people of the time lived. (LiveScience notes latrine samples from roughly the same period in Cyprus revealed the intestinal parasites that plagued the crusaders there.) \"Preliminary results of analysis show that raspberries were popular in Odense in the 1300s,\" the head archaeologist reveals. \"The contents also contain small pieces of moss, leather, and fabric, which were used as toilet paper.\" Want to take a whiff for yourself?

That means the tech company has to adhere to federal nondiscriminatory hiring practices, which a DOL lawsuit announced Wednesday says has not been the case, CNN reports. The complaint alleges Oracle has, in a \"systemic practice,\" extended higher paychecks to white males over female, African-American, and Asian workers with the same job title. On the flip side, the company is also accused of having a bias toward Asian workers (specifically, Asian Indians, per BuzzFeed), with \"targeted recruitment\" and \"referral bonuses\" coaxing \"its heavily Asian workforce to recruit other Asians.\" The DOL has been trying to address complaints of a lack of diversity in Silicon Valley, and it has filed suit in recent months against other federal contractors, including Google to turn over compensation data, data software firm Palantir for discriminating against Asian applicants, and JPMorgan Chase for gender discrimination in a complaint also filed Wednesday, per Reuters. But here\\'s where the politics supposedly come into play, which is what Oracle claims is the underlying impetus: Oracle CEO Safra Catz and Peter Thiel, co-founder of Palantir, are both members of President-elect Trump\\'s transition team, with Catz saying last month she would \"tell the president-elect that we are with him and will help in any way we can.\" An Oracle spokeswoman calls the suit \"politically motivated\" and \"wholly without merit.\"\\n',\n",

This is not an endgame. This is just a beginning,\" a leader of the Tea Party patriots told the Wall Street Journal as candidates backed by the movement swept to victory in Florida and Kentucky. In Delaware and Nevada, however, the fears of the GOP establishment were realized as Tea Party-backed candidates were defeated in races the Republicans had expected to win easily. Exit polls found that 40% of voters supported the movement, though there was little agreement on which specifics of the Tea Party agenda they backed. Many who considered themselves Tea Party supporters backed compromising with the Democrats to some degree, though activists say they have no intention of compromising even with the GOP establishment. “If Republican leaders think for a minute that they’re going to suck us in and continue business as usual, they’re wrong,\" a Tea Party activist who ran Rand Paul\\'s primary campaign in Kentucky told the New York Times.\\n',\n",

That's up from 30% of counties in 1998, with the Guardian reporting that the number of Lyme disease incidents has tripled in the US since the '90s. The biggest increases were seen in northern and northeastern states, reports CBS News, which singles out Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin. It's not surprising, then, that while some 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported annually, the real figure is estimated at a staggering 330,000 people every year. While Lyme disease continues to be fairly easy to treat via antibiotics, if left untreated it can lead to serious symptoms, including chronic joint inflammation and even heart and neurological problems years after infection, reports the CDC, which adds that the best preventive measures are removing ticks as quickly as possible and applying pesticides. Biologists blame reforestation, growing deer populations, and climate change for the fast spread of ticks that carry Lyme disease, reports the Guardian, and the researchers note in a press release the rise of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in particular.

In a since-deleted tweet, Barr wrote, \"muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.\" As the post began getting traction Tuesday, Barr took to Twitter again. \"I apologize.

Scientists in London picked up a packet of dried porcini mushrooms at the grocery store and then used a technique known as DNA barcoding, explains the CBC. When they attempted to match the DNA profiles of the dried mushrooms to known species, they discovered that three of the 15 pieces they tested were previously unknown to science.

Steve Smith was running the bases when a throw from the catcher inadvertently nailed him under his left armpit, causing cardiac arrest. “His heart stopped immediately,\" his father and coach, Tim Smith, tells ABC News. \"When I got to him he was stiff, like his body was trying to breathe but his eyes were rolled back in his head.\" Teammate Paul Dow started performing CPR, a skill he had recently learned during lifeguard training.

Smith was unconscious for a few days but woke up July 17 feeling fine. Tim Smith credits Dow for preventing his son from suffering brain damage and probably saving his life. “It’s a miracle,” he tells ABC.

       " '– A rare condition known for its polio-like effects has been diagnosed in six Minnesota children since mid-September. Per CNN, the condition is called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, and damages the body\\'s nervous system. While uncommon, AFM is serious and can lead to paralysis or even death. The state usually sees just one case of the illness per year, which the Star-Tribune reports has health officials now issuing alerts to doctors statewide. And, unlike the viral disease polio, AFM\\'s more elusive cause means there is no vaccine. \"Disease investigators are working aggressively with health care providers to gather information about the cases,\" the Minnesota Department of Public Health said in a statement. \"The department is also in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to share information.\" AFM most commonly affects young children and the cases in Minnesota, which are not isolated to one region but have instead been seen in multiple parts of the state, have all occurred in patients under age 10. AFM is believed to be most frequently triggered by some separate viral infection, leading officials to urge parents to ensure children follow basic preventative measures including hand washing, staying up-to-date on vaccinations, and avoiding mosquito bites when at all possible. Officials also want parents to be aware of early signs of AFM, which include weakness or stiffness of the neck, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, and slurred speech. With no vaccine, all doctors can do in these cases is treat symptoms and hope effects like limb paralysis aren\\'t permanent. (Meanwhile, the CDC says the disease may be on the rise.)\\n',\n",

Iraq\\'s combat against terrorism is also ours.\" Or so hopes Iraqi president Fuad Masum, who urged those in attendance to expand the fight against ISIS to Syria, reports the New York Times. \"We must not allow them to have sanctuaries. We must pursue them wherever they are.\" The Times notes that, thus far, the US has OKed only intelligence gathering over Syria. More on the ISIS front: Not in attendance at the conference: Iran. Though France \"initially opened the door to a possible role\" by the country, per the Times, John Kerry put the kibosh on the idea over fears it would dissuade Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern states from participating. Iran, for its part, says that Syria should have been invited to the table. Though it was announced yesterday that several Arab nations have agreed to join the fight against ISIS, with the BBC reporting that the anti-ISIS coalition now stands at about 40 countries including 10 Arab states, specifics remain in short supply. A BBC analyst describes a \"scramble to craft a coherent plan from contributions offered\" by the countries. The Wall Street Journal reports that while no officials have named which Mideast states might also conduct airstrikes, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, and Qatar likely have the ability to join the US campaign. As far as those airstrikes go, five weeks of them (150 strikes since President Obama\\'s speech last Wednesday, notes the New York Times) have halted the militants\\' progress, US officials tell the Journal, but the paper points out that ISIS has reacted by becoming more \"stealthy.\" Equipment isn\\'t moved in open convoys; electronic communications have been curtailed; tarps and foliage are increasingly used to shield militants from drones; and militants are hiding among locals. The upside is that \"ISIS has not gained any land since the airstrikes started,\" per one official. The downside is that they may be tougher to track.\\n',\n",

Hallquist, who transitioned from male to female in 2015, was chief executive of the Vermont Electric Cooperative before entering politics, the New York Times reports. Annise Parker of the LGBTQ Victory Fund praised the victory as a \"defining moment,\" though she added that Hallquist won \"not because of her gender identity, but because she is an open and authentic candidate ... who speaks to the issues most important to voters.\" In other results: Vermont also nominated Sen. Bernie Sanders to seek a third term, the AP reports. He won the Democratic primary, but is expected to run as an independent again. In Minnesota, Sen. Tina Smith defeated Richard Painter, George W. Bush\\'s former ethics counsel, in the Democratic primary, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. In November, she will face Republican state Sen. Karin Housley in a race to decide who will finish the last two years of former Sen. Al Franken\\'s term. Rep. Keith Ellison has won the Democratic primary for Minnesota attorney general despite allegations of domestic violence involving an ex-girlfriend that surfaced days before the election, the Washington Post reports. He placed far ahead of the other four candidates in the race, and is expected to face Republican former state lawmaker Doug Wardlow in November. In Wisconsin, Democrat Tony Evers won an eight-way gubernatorial primary and promised to end Republican Gov. Scott Walker\\'s \"reign of terror,\" the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports. Walker, who is seeking a third term, cruised to victory in the GOP primary. Former Minnesota Gov.

Former National Teacher of the Year Jahana Hayes won the Democratic primary for the House seat being vacated by scandal-plagued Rep. Elizabeth Esty, the Hartford Courant reports. If she wins in November, Hayes will be the first black Democrat from New England elected to the House.\\n',\n",

Holloway is described as \"stoic\" in the aftermath, reports USA Today, and reportedly asked a valet to call 911 after describing her actions. Police say she may have had an argument with the father of her 3-year-old daughter, who was in the vehicle; a drug expert at the scene further tells the AP that the suspect was on some type of \"stimulant,\" though the Review-Journal reports that she wasn\\'t exhibiting severe impairment, citing police sources.

       " '– Hiking alone has its disadvantages, and experienced climber, rafter, and trail runner Gregg Hein got up close and personal with most of them earlier this month. Two days into a solo hike in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks near Fresno, Calif., his footing set loose a boulder that caused the 33-year-old to fall 150 feet and broke his right leg in three places, leaving his foot \"dangling\" and his bone protruding out of his skin more than an inch. Knowing that a tourniquet would later lead to amputation, he took his chances and went without it; the bleeding eventually slowed. \"I have to get these next moments right,\" Hein tells the AP. \"What do I do to make sure I have the best chance for a positive outcome?\" Part of that meant surviving for at least three days; he wasn\\'t expected home for another two, so that\\'s how long it would take for a search party to be dispatched. Hein abandoned his heavy pack on Mount Goddard, taking a poncho, pocket knife, whistle, and bivvy sack with him as he scooted to a glacier; there, he nursed his injury with ice for four days, surviving on melted ice, moths, and crickets. He then decided he\\'d have a better chance of being spotted elsewhere; held his leg together using hiking poles, a belt, and a cord; and crawled for about a mile. On day six—July 10—two helicopters flew above him several times. \"It was kind of wrenching,\" he tells the Fresno Bee. Around 7:30pm, a \"fortuitous\" moment arrived: A crew was dropped off just 50 feet from him, and when he saw the searchers spot him, he rolled onto his back and \"breathed a deep sigh of relief.\" Full recovery is expected to take months. Hein plans to get back in the wilderness—though next time not alone, he says. (Check out which insect this man survived on for months in the wild.)\\n',\n",

It was only after they left that a cashier pointed out the $36 tip the man had left on his $28.12 bill, along with a note on the back. \"I didn\\'t know what to say,\" Hudson tells ABC News. \"I was in tears when I read it.\" It read: \"Today is my brother\\'s b-day. He would have been 36 today. Every year I go eat his favorite meal (hot dogs) and tip the waitress his age. Happy B-day Wes.\" \"It\\'s the best tip I\\'ve ever gotten,\" Hudson says, \"not because of the money, but because of the meaning.\" Hudson posted a photo of the bill on Reddit after she finished up her shift that night. \"When I woke up I was on the front page,\" she says. \"It had over 1.5 million views on Imgur and 350,000 upvotes on Reddit.\" Hudson and the owner of Mac\\'s Grub Shak now want to honor the man that inspired the generous gratuity. They hope to track down the tipper to find out exactly what Wes liked on his hot dogs so the eatery can \"name a hot dog after him.\" Hudson adds she may start a similar tradition herself. \"My best friend, he died about three years ago.

       " '– The world\\'s smallest porpoise is also ever smaller in number, its population decimated in recent decades thanks to what the Washington Post describes as \"a cruel mixture of fishing nets and economics.\" The vaquita, or \"little cow,\" has gotten tangled up in fish nets since World War II, when fishermen began to seriously hunt a species of sea bass called totoaba. The porpoise, known for sporting a little smirk, is a marine mammal that would drown in the nets where they couldn\\'t swim to the surface for air, and the appetite for totoaba has not diminished as the fish\\'s bladder is used in Chinese medicine and considered a delicacy there, fetching more than $4,000 for just one. The Mexican government has frantically decided to try to capture the remaining survivors, now around 60, to try to save the species. The US is joining in, too, offering up another marine mammal to help: the dolphin. The US Navy is training the so-called Seal Team 6 of dolphins, which already prowl around for underwater mines, to find the last surviving vaquita, which live between the Mexican mainland and Baja California Peninsula. \"Their specific task is to locate,\" one expert says. \"They would signal that by surfacing and returning to the boat from which they were launched.\" Unfortunately, the vaquita doesn\\'t thrive in captivity, where they would need to remain to be safe from fishing nets. They also reproduce very slowly, with one calf every other year. Not everyone is on board with the plan, adds Live Science. \"I don\\'t like this idea at all,\" says a rep for World Wildlife Fund Mexico. \"The risk of killing a vaquita while catching them is very high. With only 50 or 60 animals left, we can\\'t play with that.\" (Dolphins appear to chat much like humans.)\\n',\n",

       " '– For 20 years, the heart transplant unit at Sydney\\'s St. Vincent\\'s Hospital has been working hard to figure out a way to transplant a dead heart into a live patient. Today doctors from the team announced their work had paid off: They have successfully completed three transplants using hearts that had stopped beating for 20 minutes—said to be the first such transplants in the world, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Two of the patients are already up and about, while the most recent recipient is still recovering in intensive care. Heart transplants typically rely on organs taken from brain-dead donors whose hearts are still beating; the Herald reports the new development could save 30% more lives. The surgeon who performed the operations says he \"kicked the air\" after he realized the first surgery had gone well. The secret to their success lies in cutting-edge technology and the preservation solution in which the nonbeating hearts are immersed. The heart is first placed in a special \"heart in a box\" machine that warms it up and keeps it beating for about four hours before the transplant operation. The preservation solution, which alone took 12 years to develop, minimizes damage to the organ after it has stopped beating and helps ensure it both survives the surgery and functions in the recipient\\'s body, Sky News reports. Michelle Gribilas, a 57-year-old who had congestive heart failure, tells the Herald that she was \"very sick\" before having the operation two months ago, and \"now I\\'m a different person altogether. I feel like I\\'m 40 years old.\" (This woman wants to live out her heart donor\\'s bucket list.)\\n',\n",
       " '– A new report out of the Government Accountability Office reveals that the federal government will forgive at least $108 billion in student loan debt in the coming years, a higher amount than official estimates out of the federal government\\'s Education Department, the Washington Post reports. The GAO report, which Inside Higher Ed says is \"highly critical,\" looked at the federal government\\'s income-driven repayment plans, which cap borrowers\\' monthly payments based on their income and, in some cases, ultimately forgive the balance of the debt entirely. Currently, $355 billion is owed under income-driven repayment plans, and the GAO report found that $137 billion of that will never be repaid. Of that, $108 billion will be forgiven under the terms of the plans, and $29 billion will be written off due to disability or death. Those amounts only cover loans made through the current school year, the Wall Street Journal reports. Income-driven repayment plans were passed by Congress in the 1990s and 2000s, but the Obama administration beefed some of them up and increased efforts to enroll people in them; currently 5.3 million borrowers are enrolled. The GAO report could offer ammunition to congressional Republicans looking to trim such programs in an attempt to rein in costs. \"Really what the GAO is saying is that the Obama administration’s expansion of this program has been done without good information about the effects,\" says one higher-ed finance expert.\\n',\n",

Then they lost much of their wealth when the bubble burst and have been fighting eviction ever since. Though two mortgage lenders attempted to foreclose on the home, the couple managed to avoid such a fate for years thanks to multiple bankruptcy filings across several states.

On Thursday, Melbourne\\'s Federal Court of Australia handed down the fine the Aussie blogger will pay as a consequence: around $320,000, the BBC reports. The 25-year-old had made a name for herself in her home country when she claimed she\\'d beaten her cancer through a regimen of healthy living and eating, which she monetized via an app and cookbook she created, both called The Whole Pantry. Per the AP, the fine was handed down due to Gibson\\'s claims that proceeds from the app and cookbook would go to different charities. But the charities never got those funds, and that\\'s when questions started to pop up about Gibson herself. It was in mid-2015 when Gibson finally admitted she\\'d never had brain cancer, or other cancers she\\'d also initially said she had (she later called those misdiagnoses). Gibson\\'s \"pitch\" for people to throw money her way \"overwhelmingly used groups likely to evoke sympathy because of their vulnerabilities—young girls, asylum seekers, sick children,\" federal judge Debra Mortimer said in March. The Guardian notes the court had spent months trying to figure out a penalty for Gibson, and Consumer Affairs Victoria, which brought the case against Gibson, said she could\\'ve faced a fine of up to $860,000. But Mortimer had previously said it was pointless to issue a fine that Gibson would be unable to pay. Gibson wasn\\'t in court to hear Mortimer\\'s decision, instead sending an email response to the AP that said, \"Thank you for the update. Much appreciated.\"\\n',\n",

       " '– A 100-foot escape tunnel dug by Jewish prisoners using only their hands and spoons has been unearthed in Lithuania, a research team announced Wednesday. From 1941 to 1944, about 100,000 people (70,000 of them Jews from nearby Vilnius) were slaughtered by the Nazis, then dumped into burial pits in Lithuania\\'s Ponar forest—systemic murder that started even before the gas chambers in what archaeologist Richard Freund tells the New York Times was \"ground zero for the Holocaust.\" To cover up the massacre, the Nazis forced 80 Jews from the nearby Stutthof concentration camp to exhume the bodies, burn them, and hide the ashes, Ynetnews reports. These \"corpse unit\" members were kept in a deep pit during the night, and some spent those hours digging an escape tunnel. On the night of April 15, 1944, 40 of them made a break for it. Guards shot many on sight, but 11 escaped and survived the war to tell the story of the legendary tunnel. The research team led by Freund used a special geophysical process to locate the tunnel, combining radar and electrical resistivity tomography, which uses electricity to examine natural objects in the ground and soil disturbances that may have been caused by digging. These nonintrusive search methods allow scientists to explore sites that previously were off-limits, notes PBS, which will air a Nova documentary on the discovery in 2017. It also puts to bed the belief that stories told through the years about the tunnel were only a myth. \"As an Israeli whose family originated in Lithuania, I was reduced to tears on the discovery of the escape tunnel,\" an archaeologist with the Israel Antiquities Authority tells Ynetnews. \"[It] enables us to present not only the horrors of the Holocaust, but also the yearning for life.\" (Evidence of an escape tunnel was found under the Sobibor concentration camp.)\\n',\n",

With last year\\'s quiet launch of a service called Price Promise, the car shopping website is trying to \"be as close as possible to Amazon.com for the automotive experience,\" president Seth Berkowitz explained at an industry gathering yesterday. What that means, per the Detroit Free Press: Berkowitz says car shoppers\\' No. 1 gripe is the lack of a clear, exact car price; Price Promise cuts out the haggling that follows as a result by allowing dealers to email the exact price of a vehicle found on the site to shoppers who request it. Shoppers can then print out a certificate bearing the number; the dealer must sell the car for that price. Ergo, no haggling. Though the site hopes the feature will set it apart from the competition, TrueCar.com has offered a similar program since 2009, the Free Press notes; it claims 6,200 participating dealers, to Edmunds.com\\'s 600. The service also doesn\\'t factor in a buyer\\'s credit history, which could change the monthly payments, points out the Wall Street Journal. Price Promise doesn\\'t necessarily meaning getting the lowest price, either. Dealers say they sell cars to Price-Promise users for $300 to $500 more than traditional buyers. But according to Berkowitz, it\\'s a worthwhile tradeoff for those looking to save time and avoid headaches.\\n',\n",

The complaint states Marie Hatch moved into her Burlingame cottage more than 60 years ago at the request of her friend Vivian Kroeze, who owned the property and needed companionship after her husband died. Hatch was promised a lifetime tenancy, and the promise was honored by Kroeze\\'s daughter and granddaughter after Vivian Kroeze died in 1980.

Democrats who back the program—which they say creates thousands of auto-related jobs—were outraged, and the Senate immediately vowed to reject the bill because it didn’t provide enough funding for disaster relief efforts. “The House bill is not an honest effort at compromise,” Harry Reid told the New York Times. “They moved even further toward the Tea Party.” But if something doesn’t pass, FEMA will run out of money next week, and the government will shut down Oct. 1.\\n',\n",

On Thursday, Farrow appeared on CBS This Morning and says she wishes there\\'d been a trial since \"I was already traumatized\" from the alleged assault on August 4, 1992. That\\'s when Farrow says her \"hero\" led her to the attic of Mia Farrow\\'s Connecticut residence and \"touched my labia and my vulva with his finger.\" Dylan Farrow was 7 at the time. The now-32-year-old mom told interviewer Gayle King she felt it was necessary to finally come forward on TV, saying, \"I want to show my face and tell my story. ... I want to speak out. Literally.\" And she has supporters in high places, including Mira Sorvino and Natalie Portman, per Time. Although Allen vowed in 2014 to never again comment on the allegations from his adopted daughter, he broke that vow Thursday. \"I never molested my daughter,\" the director says in a statement to CBS News. He adds two investigations—one by a hospital\\'s child abuse clinic and another by child welfare investigators in New York—previously \"concluded that no molestation had ever taken place\" and it was \"likely a vulnerable child had been coached to tell the story by her angry mother during a contentious breakup. ... Sadly, I\\'m sure Dylan truly believes what she says.\" Dylan Farrow refutes that, noting that \"my mother has only encouraged me to tell the truth,\" adding she wonders why \"this crazy story of me being brainwashed\" is more believable than her own account.

The mother—who had lived in Brazil last year, a hotspot for the mosquito-borne illness—was likely infected early in her pregnancy before leaving for Hawaii. Meanwhile, the CDC on Friday advised pregnant women, along with those trying to become pregnant, to avoid traveling to areas known for Zika, including Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico, CNN reports. Carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the Zika virus typically causes only mild symptoms, or none at all, reports the Times. Late last year, however, health officials in Brazil began to find a correlation between the disease and an increase in cases of microcephaly. More than 3,500 cases, including 46 infant deaths, in the nation may be linked to Zika, CNN reports. In the US, 14 imported cases of the virus were diagnosed in returning travelers between 2007 and 2014, plus a total of eight in 2015 and so far this year.

       " '– An alimony deduction to be erased in 2019 under the new tax plan has lawyers preparing for a wave of divorces this year—and eying complications for recipients beyond. Payers have long received a tax break on alimony, while recipients have paid income tax on payments. But after Dec. 31, 2018, alimony will no longer be deductible for the payer, and recipients won\\'t need to pay income tax on it, reports Politico. While this will help recipients—primarily women—in one sense, they\\'ll suffer in other ways. As lawyer Madeline Marzano-Lesnevich tells Yahoo, a man in the highest income-tax bracket who pays his wife $100,000 in alimony in 2018 ($85,000 for the woman after taxes) actually pays about $60,000 with the deduction. Without it, he might argue $60,000 is all he can afford to pay, leaving the wife with $25,000 less than before. Attorneys predict the change will complicate divorce negotiations and lead to more cases being heard in court. But some say women will be disproportionally injured by it. \"The repeal reduces the bargaining power of vulnerable spouses, mostly women, in achieving financial stability after a divorce,\" a lawyer tells Politico. Others point out alimony recipients may have a harder time saving for retirement as contributions to retirement accounts often have to come from taxed income, per CNBC. Marzano-Lesnevich says her firm has already had \"a rush of clients … demanding we get them divorced immediately\" to avoid such complications in 2019. More couples are expected to follow suit this year. Politico reports removing the deduction is expected to raise $6.9 billion over the next decade and help offset the cost of tax cuts outlined in the GOP bill.\\n',\n",

The video of the beating, which took place late yesterday only blocks from the presidential palace where protests were raging in the streets, further inflamed popular anger with security forces just as several thousand anti-government demonstrators marched on the palace again today. The uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011 was fueled in part by anger over police brutality. In the footage aired live on Egyptian TV, at least seven black-clad riot police used sticks to beat 48-year-old Hamada Saber, who was sprawled out on the ground, shirtless and with his pants down around his ankles. In a statement, the Interior Ministry voiced its \"regret\" about the assault, and vowed to investigate. But it also sought to distance itself—and the police in general—from the abuse, saying it \"was carried out by individuals that do not represent in any way the doctrine of all policemen.\" Later in the day, Interior Minister Mohammed Ibrahim put the blame elsewhere entirely, saying initial results from the public prosecutor\\'s investigation indicated that Saber was undressed by \"rioters\" during skirmishes between police and protesters.

But this wasn\\'t just a random scammer who\\'d figured out how to play the machine: It was part of an elaborate Russian hacking scheme Brendan Koerner explores for Wired. That patron, Murat Bliev, was a member of a St. Petersburg cheat group, a willing participant in what Koerner describes as a \"hotbed of slots-related malfeasance.\" This underground movement originated in 2009, when then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided to make most gambling illegal to curb organized crime. All of the slot machines in Russian casinos had to go somewhere, and so many of them ended up with high bidders (including Bliev\\'s organization), who then poked around in the machines\\' coding to figure out how to exploit them. How the racket-runners worked: They figured out the patterns behind the machines\\' pseudorandom number generators, or PRNGs, which, while difficult to crack, aren\\'t impossible if someone can get into the machine\\'s insides. But because the \"temporal state\" of each machine is different, additional surveillance steps were needed in combination with the PRNG intel—and a casino security expert figured out how the hackers pulled it off. The scheme involved cellphones with video, a tech team back in St. Petersburg, and vibrating \"timing markers\" sent to the players to indicate when to hit. While Bliev and others were eventually busted, the hacking still lives on via enhanced methods, as there\\'s \"no easy technical fix. \"A finger that lingers too long above a spin button may be a guard\\'s only clue,\" Koerner writes.

Experts at the University of Vermont and the MITRE Corporation went through volumes of text from all kinds of sources: books, the news, music lyrics, movie subtitles, and more, including some 100 billion words used on Twitter, UVM reports. Investigating 10 languages, they picked out the 10,000 most common words, then had native speakers rank these words on a nine-point happiness scale; \"laughter,\" for instance, was rated 8.5, while \"greed\" came in at 3.06. All 24 types of sources reviewed resulted in scores above the neutral 5, meaning they leaned \"happy.\" In other words, \"people use more positive words than negative ones,\" a researcher says. As far as individual languages go, here are the top five happiest ones, via Discovery: Spanish Portuguese English German French Chinese came in last of the 10 languages in the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The brother, whose name is Syed Raheel Farook, was falsely identified as the gunman by some media outlets because the names are so similar, but he is, in fact, a decorated Navy veteran, BuzzFeed reports. The brother joined up in August 2003 and left the service in August 2007, and Navy records state that he received the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon during his service, which included time as an information systems technician on the USS Enterprise.

(\"Not showing the world my gown before the wedding is very important,\" her suit says, per Page Six.) But a Manhattan judge refused Thursday, meaning Godino\\'s dress will be unveiled publicly before she walks down the aisle. It all started back in September, when Godino, who is from Las Vegas and getting married in California, was approached at New York\\'s Kleinfeld Bridal by producers who told her the bride they were supposed to be filming never showed up, and asked her if she was interested in filling in, the New York Daily News reports. Godino, 26, says she first made the producers promise they wouldn\\'t air the episode until after her wedding, a promise that her lawyer says was witnessed by her mom and her fiance, professional hockey player Jeff May. But Godino signed a waiver that included no restrictions about when the show could air, so the judge ruled against her despite acknowledging that airing the episode Friday \"could take away from the pageantry of the wedding.\" Pageantry indeed: The dress to which Godino said yes reportedly cost $40,000 and is \"one of the most important aspects of [her] entire wedding,\" per the suit.

The insiders say that Trump backed down after lawyers contacted Mueller\\'s team and determined that the reports were what the president would describe as \"FAKE NEWS.\" The Times reported earlier this year that the chief White House lawyer refused Trump\\'s order to fire Mueller last June.

One of Australia\\'s largest freshwater turtle species—which can live to be 100—white-throated snapping turtles do indeed possess an unusual skill: cloacal respiration, by which they extract oxygen from water via their backsides, reports James Cook University. Thanks to dams, though, water is becoming too sluggish for this kind of breathing, bringing the reptiles to the surface, where they\\'re vulnerable to predators, and restricting them from traveling to find mates. And their eggs take seven months to hatch, which is plenty of time to be eaten or trampled. \"Almost nothing is surviving,\" Schaffer says. \"There is nothing coming up to replace them.

If the account is verified—and it was apparently documented on video—it would best the previous longest kill made by a British sniper in 2009 of 2,475 meters. The gunman used a McMillan TAC-50, which Newsweek notes is the standard rifle among Canada\\'s well-regarded snipers, and took the shot from a high-rise building in an unspecified locale in Iraq.

In fact, at that distance, the shooter would also have to account for the curvature of the earth, he adds.

According to the Washington Post, that means more than half of Florida's massive death row population could potentially avoid execution. Last January, the US Supreme Court found Florida's death penalty violated the Sixth Amendment because it gave judges too much power, and juries too little, in deciding whether the guilty party lives or dies. It had told Arizona essentially the same thing way back in 2002. So on Thursday, the Florida supreme court ruled that the 55% of death row inmates who received their sentences after 2002 have the right to seek new sentencing trials. According to the ruling, no guilty verdicts will be changed and no one will be let out of prison prior to their new sentencing. The ruling also does the opposite for the half of death row inmates sentenced before 2002, the Miami Herald reports. They will not be allowed to seek new sentencing, meaning executions can start again in Florida for the first time since the US Supreme Court's ruling.

Now this installation is temporarily closed.\" Luckily for the hapless visitor, the hole isn\\'t actually unfathomable: It\\'s just 8 feet deep, with the sides painted black to make it appear deeper than it really is. The fall into or near the \"void\" happened despite security and signs cautioning visitors about the exhibit. In the injured party\\'s defense, Gizmodo points out the hole \"appears to have no depth at all … like a real-life version of a \\'Looney Tunes\\' cartoon.\" On Friday, a museum rep said the apparently disoriented tourist has already left the hospital; the London Times reports he suffered back injuries. Meanwhile the exhibit will be open again for viewing (but hopefully not stumbling over) \"in a few days,\" the rep noted. (This 90-year-old ruined a work of art, had an unusual reaction.)\\n',\n",
       " '– The e-book boom looks to be finished, writes Nicholas Carr at the Rough Type blog. He picks up on stats from the Association of American Publishers that show just a 5% increase in sales in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the previous year. That\\'s \"anemic,\" he writes, and continues the trend of rapidly declining sales growth from 2012. E-books are still hurting print books, whose sales fell about 5% in the first quarter, but the digital versions seem to be settling in at about the 25% mark of total book sales. \"In spite of the spectacular growth of e-books in 2008 to 2011, we all know that eventually the ride would come to a stop as the growth of e-book market share slowed,\" writes Nate Hoffelder at the Digital Reader. \"I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly.\" Lots of reasons might be at play, but Carr wonders whether the drop is being helped along by the switch to multitasking tablets instead of devices (like the original Kindle) dedicated solely to reading. \"Are tablets less conducive to book buying and reading than e-readers were?\" Meanwhile, the numbers are worse worldwide: Nielsen Research says e-book sales actually declined in the first quarter—the first time that\\'s happened, reports Publishing Technology.\\n',\n",
       " '– Want to keep a demon-skeleton from haunting your rural settlement? Just bury it with a sickle at its throat. That\\'s what researchers are saying about four skeletons from the 17th and 18th centuries found buried with iron sickles around their necks in a Polish cemetery, Discovery reports. Writing in Antiquity, Marek Polcyn and Elzbieta Gajda say the skeletons—two adult females, an adult male, and an adolescent female excavated with over 250 human remains starting in 2008—may have been feared as possible demons in Drawsko, northwestern Poland. The sickles \"may have been a measure to prevent the demonized soul threatening the living, or could have been a reference to biblical symbolism in an attempt to prevent the soul from becoming demonized,\" the authors write. They dismiss the theory that the villagers feared vampirism, saying the burials were conventionally Christian, with heads pointing west, and the graves don\\'t seem desecrated. Perhaps the burials followed the folk belief that a person with a \"bad death\" (like drowning, suicide, or death during childbirth) was prone to being inhabited by one of fourteen demons. Such beliefs persisted alongside Slavic pagan faith and Christianity in Poland at the time, Live Science reports. Interestingly, a fifth skeleton had the sickle around her hips, a stone at her neck, and a coin in her mouth. \"Coins were placed in the mouth to favor the deceased\\'s passage into the afterlife,\" one expert says. \"The sickle and the stone would have prevent[ed] the dead from returning.\" (Read about self-identified vampires who have \"a real fear.\")\\n',\n",
       " '– If the allegations against Roy Moore lead to a Democrat winning Alabama\\'s US Senate race next month, it could \"reshape Washington\\'s political landscape,\" NBC News reports. The Republican majority in the Senate would go down to 51-49, which leaves Democrats a much more likely path to flipping things in 2018. To get control of the Senate, they\\'d need to keep all their vulnerable seats and add Arizona and Nevada, where NBC estimates they have at least a 50% chance of victory. And even before the 2018 elections, the GOP tax plan could be in trouble—the slimmer Republicans\\' margin of control in the Senate, the harder they have to work to get senators like Rand Paul, Bob Corker, and Susan Collins on board since they can only afford to lose one GOP vote. For now, it doesn\\'t seem Moore—accused of molesting a 14-year-old when he was 32, among other things—is planning to withdraw so another Republican can run in his place; it\\'s unclear whether he\\'d even be able to withdraw at this late date. Alabama\\'s state auditor defended Moore Thursday by comparing his situation to that of Mary and Joseph, a Biblical couple with a big age difference who \"became parents of Jesus.\" In the Washington Post, Aaron Blake calls Jim Zeigler\\'s words \"the worst defense\" of Moore so far. If Moore did what he\\'s accused of, it was illegal, hands down—not just \"unusual\" as Zeigler calls it. Blake notes that evangelical leaders are also slamming Zeigler\\'s remarks. Another Jesus comparison: Roy Moore\\'s brother says the politician is being persecuted like Christ was, CNN reports. Jerry Moore also said he\\'s very concerned about the effect all this will have on their 91-year-old mother.\\n',\n",

The move comes after more than 500,000 people in the UK signed a petition calling for the ban because of Trump\\'s idea to temporarily ban Muslims from coming to the US. No vote will follow the debate, reports Reuters, making this more an airing of views. Interior minister Theresa May is the only one who can issue such a ban, and the Guardian reports that it doesn\\'t look likely. Still, it should be lively. \"What I will be doing today is asking that Theresa May exercise constancy in her approach to people who preach hatred,\" says Scottish National Party lawmaker Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh. But Labour lawmaker Paul Flynn think it\\'s misguided—not that he sounds like a Trump fan. \"Sadly a ban would perversely help him in America, and that is where opinion matters,\" he says. \"It would probably give him a halo of victimhood as a martyr and perversely that will attract more support for him.\" No tweets so far from Trump about Monday\\'s debate, though he has previously threatened to yank $1 billion in investments in golf courses in Scotland if he is banned.

The way things are going, the terror group soon won\\'t qualify as an official adversary of the military, the Pentagon\\'s top lawyer said in a speech at London\\'s Oxford University last night, reports the Guardian. Two key points by Jeh Johnson, who, incidentally, is thought to be a top contender for attorney general when Eric Holder steps down in about a year: \"I do believe that on the present course there will come a tipping point, a tipping point at which so many of the leaders and operatives of al-Qaeda and its affiliates have been killed or captured, and the group is no longer able to attempt or launch a strategic attack against the United States, such that al-Qaeda as we know it, the organization that our Congress authorized the military to pursue in 2001, has been effectively destroyed.\" \"At that point we must be able to say to ourselves that our efforts should no longer be considered an armed conflict against al-Qaeda and its associated forces, rather a counter-terrorism effort against individuals who are the scattered remains of al-Qaeda … for which the law enforcement and intelligence resources of our government are principally responsible.\" The military would play a more limited role, stepping in when necessary. The speech is part of the administration\\'s long-range efforts to clarify its counterterror rules, explains the Wall Street Journal, which susses out a tangible possibility: Remaining detainees at Gitmo are held under the 2001 Authority for the Use of Military Force against al-Qaeda. If that decree is no longer in effect a few years down the road, it presents an avenue for the release of prisoners and closure of the detention facility.\\n',\n",

When it comes to medical marijuana, the feds have tended to crack down on large operations and leave small, personal growers alone; that track record may offer a model for enforcement under the new laws. For its part, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency says its stance \"remains unchanged,\" the New York Times notes. But “I don’t see DEA agents sweeping in ... and enforcing drug laws that were previously enforced by local agencies,” says a former Seattle police chief. \"It would be extremely poor politics. The will of the people has been expressed.” The new law could bring in $180 million in taxes and savings over three years, says a Colorado group: \"We want to be a model for the rest of the country on how to do this right.\" Washington advocates similarly say pot shops could bring in $500 million to $600 million in taxes annually. But thorny issues remain, including how to establish bank accounts for a business that\\'s federally banned, the Wall Street Journal notes. \"This will be a complicated process, but we intend to follow through,\" says Colorado Gov.

At least 39 people, including four US troops, have been killed in protests over the Korans. The Taliban also claimed responsibility for another, less deadly, attack, CNN reports. The group claimed it was responsible for the poisoning of food at a military base near the Pakistan border. A NATO spokesman says contaminated food was found at Forward Operating Base Torkham after a tip-off, but nobody got sick. \"The dining facility was shut down and we brought in environmental health, who found traces of chlorine bleach in the coffee and fruit,\" he says. \"Soldiers are now eating pre-prepared rations and no one was affected.

Two officers—one of whom graduated from the police academy just two weeks ago—were injured in the shootout but they are both expected to survive. One officer was hit in the ribs but was wearing a protective vest, while the other was grazed by a bullet, reports NBC. The SUV driver fled and hid during the shootout but soon turned himself in; the pickup driver, who was wounded in the leg, was captured about 90 minutes later in woods off Interstate 64, the AP reports. The suspects are from Texas and claim to be father and son, say police, who stopped the SUV after spotting stolen North Carolina plates. The victims found in the back of the truck have been identified as Jerome Faulkner, 73 and his wife, Dora Faulkner, 62.

At an estimated 3,500 years old, National Geographic calls it \"Europe\\'s earliest metal body part\"—though it subsequently narrows that to \"the earliest metal representation\" of one. As Gizmodo explains, archaeologists don\\'t believe someone wore the hand but, rather, that an internal socket allowed it to be affixed atop a stick or pole. It was unearthed by metal detector-armed treasure hunters searching around Lake Biel in what archaeologists later discovered was a grave in extreme disrepair. It held the bones of a middle-aged man, along with items that included a bronze pin and one of the bronze hand\\'s fingers. Because the hand was taken from the scene in a less-than-scientific way, any knowledge that could be gleaned about its use based on how it might have been arranged with the buried man\\'s body has been lost to history. That\\'s left Andrea Schaer of the Bern Archaeological Service with only speculations: \"It must have been placed on something, but we don’t know what\"—National Geographic suggests \"it could have adorned a statue, been mounted on a stick and wielded like a scepter, or even worn as a prosthetic as part of a ritual.\" A press release notes \"its gold ornament suggests that it is an emblem of power, a distinctive sign of the social elite, even of a deity.\" Gizmodo reports on a weird twist: a criminal investigation is underway based on authorities\\' belief that some items may have been stolen from the grave.

It marks the first time in three years that growth has hit that mark for two consecutive quarters, per the AP. The Commerce Department says the July-September advance in the gross domestic product—the country\\'s total output of goods and services—followed a 3.1% rise in the second quarter. It was the strongest two-quarter showing since back-to-back gains of 4.6% and 5.2% in the second and third quarters of 2014. The economy accelerated this summer despite the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which many private economists believe shaved at least one-half percentage point off growth. The Wall Street Journal sees the growth as \"particularly impressive\" because of those storms, having forecast something closer to 2.7%.

Per the BBC, fathers can pass down a gene mutation to their daughters that can raise the risk of ovarian cancer, per a study published Thursday in Plos Genetics. The 30-year study of nearly 3,500 grandmother/granddaughter pairs culled from the Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry found that women had a spiked risk of ovarian cancer if their grandmothers on their fathers\\' side had had the disease. The mutation, which was found to be distinct from the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations that are inherited from both parents, was also tied to a higher rate of prostate cancer in both the fathers and their sons, per News.com.au. To work out their experiment, researchers pulled 186 women with ovarian cancer and sequenced their X chromosomes. What they found was women whose paternal grandmothers suffered from the disease had double the risk of developing the cancer than those whose maternal grandmothers had had it. Daughters get a total of one X chromosome from their dads, and on that chromosome is where the possibly mutated MAGEC3 gene lies. Women can receive the gene from their moms as well—but since their fathers are only giving them one X chromosome, if the gene is mutated, the daughters are sure to receive it, per Newsweek. Women with this mutated gene also seemed to get ovarian cancer nearly seven years earlier than they would have without the mutated gene. That means if sisters within one family get ovarian cancer, all paths may lead back to Dad. \"A family with three daughters who all have ovarian cancer is more likely to be driven by inherited X mutations than by BRCA mutations,\" study co-author Kevin Eng says. (Scientists hope a blood test may one day catch ovarian cancer early.)\\n',\n",

Grasso says he\\'s not opposed to reading about ideas and beliefs opposed to his own—and fully expects to do so at Duke—but having to look at pictures is a whole different matter. \"I think there is an important distinction between images and written words,\" he writes. \"If the book explored the same themes without sexual images or erotic language, I would have read it.\" In his view, the images violate the \"sacredness of sex.\" Grasso writes that he knows his is a minority view, but \"cultural pluralism will lose its value if students aren\\'t allowed to follow their beliefs, even if they are conservative.\" At Quartz, however, SUNY Brockport instructor Amber Humphrey writes that education \"obliges us to read, hear, and see things that we might not otherwise encounter.\" If these students aren\\'t prepared to do that, maybe Duke should show them the door. \"Let them reapply when they are ready to face the danger presented by a comic book.\" (Click to read her full column, or Grasso\\'s full column.)\\n',\n",

The Land Report is out with its annual list of the 100 largest private landholders in America, and sitting on top is a man who made his fortune in the telecom business. Liberty Media Chairman John Malone has 2.2 million acres across the US, spread across several states from coast to coast. The Washington Post highlights a rich-are-getting-richer component of the list: In 2007, the 100 biggest landowners collectively had 27 million acres.

Tuvalu and Tokelau have declared states of emergency because of the water crisis, caused by six months of low or no rainfall and by groundwater becoming contaminated with seawater, the BBC reports. New Zealand\\'s air force has rushed bottled water and desalination machines to the areas most in need. In Tuvalu, a nation of atolls that is home to around 11,000 people, the situation is \"quite dire,\" a Red Cross team leader says. The crisis is spreading, with Samoa now rationing water, and experts believe that because of La Niña, the region won\\'t see any rainfall until at least until the end of the year. The water crisis is expected to trickle down into food shortages, and sanitation and public health problems, the AP reports, and officials say the future of the island nations is looking increasingly uncertain.\\n',\n",

Researches found workaholism was statistically linked with anxiety, depression, OCD, and ADHD. “Workaholics scored higher on all the psychiatric symptoms than non-workaholics,\" researcher Cecilie Schou Andreassen says in a press release. Researchers found 32.7% of workaholics had ADHD versus 12.7% of non-workaholics; 25.6% had OCD versus 8.7% of non-workaholics; 33.8% had anxiety versus 11.9% of non-workaholics; and 8.9% had depression versus 2.6% of non-workaholics. Without further research, the nature of the relationship between workaholism and common psychiatric conditions is unclear. But Schou Andreassen notes, “Taking work to the extreme may be a sign of deeper psychological or emotional issues.\" Researchers found 7.8% of the nearly 16,500 adults studied were workaholics, which they determined with a series of seven statements participants could rank, including, “You think of how you can free up more time to work” and “You become stressed if you are prohibited from working.” But not everyone is convinced. “Any human behavior can be turned into a disease,” a professor at Liverpool University tells the Financial Times. “It’s this tendency to pathologize the usual messy realities of life, of which work is one.” (Here\\'s why we shouldn\\'t have to find meaning in work.)\\n',\n",

Instead, His Holiness—or @franciscus, as he\\'s now known on Instagram—posted a picture of himself praying along with the phrase \"pray for me\" in nine languages. CNN reports the Pope had 100,000 Instagram followers within an hour of launching his account. His first post had more than 65,000 likes and nearly 12,000 comments in the first three hours. Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom, who met with the Pope last month, called the Pope\\'s first Instagram post \"an incredible moment\" and said his \"messages of humility, compassion and mercy will leave a lasting mark,\" according to Time. A Vatican spokesperson says the Pope joining Instagram is a \"particularly smart move\" because it\\'s quickly becoming more popular in Catholic-heavy countries like Italy, Mexico, and Brazil. Pope Francis has embraced social media during his three years in the position. He actually announced his first Instagram post on Twitter, were he has nearly 9 million followers. \"I am beginning a new journey, on Instagram, to walk with you along the path of mercy and the tenderness of God,\" the Pope tweeted.

However, he reportedly made another statement regarding the president during his appearance, one that was cut from the show\\'s final broadcast. Per the New York Post, West was booed by the audience as he ranted during closing credits that Democrats want to keep black Americans on welfare. He then addressed his well-known support of President Trump. \"I talk to like a white person about this and they say, ‘How could you like Trump? He’s racist.’\" West said. \"Well, if I was concerned about racism I would’ve moved out of America a long time ago.” Per the Hollywood Reporter, West also briefly suggested a 2020 run could be in his future. In the audience was former SNL cast member Chris Rock, who recorded West\\'s statement on video and cringed audibly from behind the camera as West spoke. Among West\\'s supporters was none other than the president himself, who tweeted Sunday that he doesn\\'t watch the show (\"a political ad for the Dems\") but that he heard about West\\'s hat. \"Word is that Kanye West, who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told \\'no\\'), was great,\" Trump wrote, per the AP. \"He\\'s leading the charge!\" Among the topics tackled earlier in the Adam Driver-hosted premiere were the Kavanaugh testimony and show writer Pete Davidson\\'s engagement to singer Ariana Grande.\\n',\n",

The Pirelli Calendar—which usually shows skinny models and actresses in soft-core poses—is breaking from tradition this year by using photos of successful women across various fields, the Daily Beast reports. \"The goal was to be very straightforward,\" says photographer Annie Leibovitz, who snapped the shots for the 43rd edition. \"I wanted the pictures to show the women exactly as they are, with no pretense.\" Only Schumer and Williams (who were each criticized by body-shamers in recent months) are posing in the near-buff, notes Slate. Schumer tweeted about it this way: Beautiful, gross, strong, thin, fat, pretty, ugly, sexy, disgusting, flawless, woman. Thank you @annieleibovitz — Amy Schumer, November 30, 2015 Among others posing for Leibovitz are Ava DuVernay, director of Selma; Yao Chen, a Chinese goodwill ambassador to the UN; Kathleen Kennedy, Lucasfilm producer; Natalia Vodianova, ex-supermodel; Shirin Neshat, Iranian artist; and Yoko Ono. Seems Leibovitz chose her models: \"Pirelli has always given free rein to the photographer,\" she tells the Guardian. \"I think the company has wanted to shift for a few years and my mandate was that they wanted to see some change.\" So will the calendar revert to sexy poses next year? It\\'s unclear, but Neshat tells the New York Times that \"it would be a huge disappointment\" if Pirelli chose to \"abandon the idea of the women who define modern life, and go back to sexy girls who are too young to have accomplished anything.\" (Miley Cyrus recently did a nude photo shoot, too.)\\n',\n",

A sampling of the day\\'s top unsolicited advice: \"It may be tempting to list a series of measures Obama wants Congress to pass,\" but Obama should avoid a laundry list, warns historian Julian Zelizer at CNN. \"The president should think big,\" perhaps using the speech, as FDR did in 1941, to \"offer a vision\" for America, or to take a bold gamble, as Abraham Lincoln did by supporting emancipation in 1862. Or he can simply be honest about today\\'s challenges, as Gerald Ford was when he said the state of the union \"is not good.\" Obama should invoke Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan by emphasizing \"America\\'s embrace of human and democratic rights, values that transcend parties and administrations,\" suggests Albert Hunt at Bloomberg. \"Even Senator John McCain, in a grouchy mood, would applaud.\" \"President Obama is apparently planning to give us yet another salvo in that left-right war,\" laments David Brooks in the New York Times. \"But it would be great if Obama gave an imaginative speech that reframed things as present versus future.\" Somewhere along the line, America went from a forward-looking nation to a consumption-minded one. Smart investments in tomorrow could change that. Meanwhile, Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post has a more scientific look at what Obama should and shouldn\\'t say, noting that in polls some policy ideas, like a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, became less popular when Obama\\'s name was attached to them.

Starring Jennifer Lawrence, it\\'s a bloody affair that might not be worth its 2.5-hour run time, based on what critics are saying. It had a 52% positive rating among critics, and a slightly higher one from audiences: Peter Howell doesn\\'t recommend it. At the Toronto Star, he calls Red Sparrow \"the anti-007\" in which \"the sex is rape by any name, the tech is ancient floppy disks and the fighting is artless and bloody.\" Additional drawbacks are an \"overly plotted screenplay,\" and Lawrence\\'s \"dodgy\" Russian accent, \"which approaches parody,\" Howell writes. Overall, it\\'s \"a brutal, muddled and dispiriting watch.\" Manohla Dargis disagrees, applauding Lawrence\\'s ability to \"slip into a role as if sliding into another skin.\" She delivers \"a serviceable accent,\" but it\\'s \"her absolute ease and certainty that carry you through Red Sparrow,\" a \"preposterously entertaining\" film, Dargis writes at the New York Times, pointing out how rare it is to see a female character be the victim and perpetrator of \"startling\" violence. \"With Cold War tensions rising again in real life, Red Sparrow feels of this time in a cool way, but only Lawrence\\'s spy is memorable in this so-so operation,\" writes Brian Truitt at USA Today. \"There\\'s so much good stuff\"—Dominika is \"a fascinating study\" and Lawrence \"fits the role like a new pair of pointe shoes\"—\"but it never jells in a satisfying way.\" The film is also too long and a \"hard watch due to its brutality,\" Truitt writes. Lawrence \"gives her all,\" but it\\'s not enough for Mark Kennedy, either. \"What really drives Dominika is never very clear\" and she ends up \"like a reflection of the film itself, getting flatter and more boring by the minute,\" he writes at the AP. He also criticizes the \"muddled\" story and \"cartoon violence,\" perhaps best exhibited in a scene involving the peeling of skin. \"That might be more fun than sitting though Red Sparrow,\" he writes.\\n',\n",

That\\'s what lawmakers are trying to decide about kratom, a tree-like plant from Southeast Asia, the New York Times reports. The FDA has banned kratom imports while four states (Wyoming, Vermont, Tennessee, and Indiana) have made it illegal, but more kratom bars are emerging that serve the leaf in drink form, and powdered versions are available online and everywhere from convenience stores to gas stations. \"It\\'s a mind-altering substance, so people like me who are addicts and alcoholics, they think just because it\\'s legal, it\\'s fine,\" says Florida resident Dariya Pankova, who took kratom for heroin withdrawal. \"It\\'s a huge epidemic down here, and it’s causing a lot of relapses.” Long taken as a stimulant in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia, kratom contains something called mitragynine that seems to cause \"opiod-like effects,\" per Medscape. But kratom also has been linked to respiratory depression, seizures, and possibly suicide; makers of the herbal-liquid \"feel good\" supplement Vivazen recently removed kratom from its ingredients, Bevnet reports. Yet advocates like the American Kratom Association say the leaf helps wean people off dangerous drugs, and Reason argues that states\\' arguments against kratom (that it\\'s an opioid or synthetic drug) are incorrect. \"It all boils down to the interpretation of the law,\" says a drug official in Alabama, where one county banned all kratom products last month, ABC 3340 reports. \"My district attorney interprets it [as] illegal because it hits the opiate receptor of the brain.\" (One country may give heroin addicts what they want: heroin.)\\n',\n",

(They were found on the computer of Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, during a separate investigation of him.) Some of the latest developments: The Justice Department and the FBI is seeking a warrant to conduct a full search of the Abedin emails, but the issue is tricky because the computer belongs to Weiner, not Abedin, explains CNN. The subpoena under which it was seized relates only to the allegations that he was sexting with an underage girl. When the search begins, it will take weeks because the laptop has a total of about 650,000 emails. It\\'s not clear how many of those were sent to or from Clinton\\'s private server, but that figure is probably in the \"thousands,\" reports the Wall Street Journal. Some may be duplicates that already have been seen by the FBI. Meanwhile, talks also are under way with Abedin\\'s lawyers to gain access to the emails, reports USA Today. Abedin has told people she has no idea how her emails ended up on her husband\\'s computer, reports the Washington Post. Her lawyers didn\\'t search it when they were turning over her emails to the State Department, because she was reportedly unaware they were on it. A separate Post story says FBI agents had known for weeks about the emails on Weiner\\'s computer but delayed telling FBI chief James Comey for reasons that are unclear. The chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration thinks the FBI\\'s Comey has run afoul of the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to sway an election.

It\\'s addressed to one Raymond Hamilton, a one-time member of their gang who, at the time the letter was written, was behind bars in the Dallas County Jail. That he was there was a reflection of just how \"yellow\" he was, per the letter, as he didn\\'t try to flee as he was captured. The Dallas Morning News reports the trio had a falling out over Hamilton\\'s girlfriend (the \"prostitute sweetheart\" the letter refers to); the AP cites a disagreement over how to divvy up $4,000 they had taken from a Texas bank earlier that year. This after Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker famously rescued Hamilton and four others from a Texas prison farm in January 1934, per a New York Daily News article written that year. Hamilton was serving sentences totaling 262 years at the time. The lines are biting. \"I should have killed you then I would have saved myself much bother and money looking for you,\" reads the letter, which Boston-based RR Auction says was likely dictated by Barrow to Parker, who had superior writing skills. It closes by telling Hamilton, \"I hope this will serve the purpose of letting you know that you can never expect the least of sympathy or assistance from me. So long.\" But he may not have ever seen it. Sheriff Richard \"Smoot\" Schmid intercepted it and later publicized it; his family is now auctioning it off.

But judges last Wednesday evened the count to 11,608 for both, and the race is now set to be determined by lot, with the aforementioned film canister and one containing the name of Republican rival/incumbent David Yancey put in a 180-year-old turquoise pitcher, reports the Washington Post.

He says governments should tax companies that replace workers with machines and use that money to fund jobs that can only be performed by humans, such as caring for children and the elderly. In what is perhaps a surprising declaration for a man who built his fortune through innovation, the billionaire philanthropist contends the pace of automation in job-killing industries ought to be slowed, and taxes can help do that. \"It is really bad if people overall have more fear about what innovation is going to do than they have enthusiasm,\" he says.

Timothy Coggins was 23 when his body was found in a grassy area 30 miles south of downtown Atlanta in 1983. Spalding County Sheriff Darrell Dix says Coggins was \"brutally murdered.\" According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Dix says suspects at the time threatened and intimidated possible witnesses, and the case was never solved. \"It worried everybody to death, but we never could find out what was going on, so life just continued,\" a friend of Coggins tells WSB. The case was reopened in March after new evidence turned up, and the original witnesses—afraid to come forward at the time—were re-interviewed. It\\'s unclear what the new evidence was. Bill Moore, 58, and Frankie Gebhardt, 59, were charged with murder, aggravated assault, and more. Gregory Huffman, 47, was charged with obstruction and violation of oath of office. He was fired as a detention officer with the sheriff\\'s office following his arrest. Lamar Bunn, a police officer in a nearby town, was charged with obstruction. His mother, Sandra Bunn, was also charged with obstruction. Dix says investigators believe the murder was \"racially motivated\" and would be considered a hate crime today. \"It was meant to send a message and it was brutal,\" he says. Officials say more arrests are possible. \"We have always wanted justice, held out for justice, and knew that we would have justice,\" the victim\\'s niece, Heather Coggins, says.\\n',\n",

Hadid had been taken to a local hospital for bronchitis earlier this week and suffered a sudden heart attack while she was being treated there, per a statement from her London office. Known as the \"Queen of Curves\" for her \"signature flowing style,\" Business Insider notes, she was the only female architect to ascend to the ranks of what Quartz labels as her profession\\'s elite \"starchitects\" group. The Iraqi-born Brit was known for her designs for, among others, the London Aquatic Center (a 2012 Olympics venue), China\\'s Guangzhou Opera House, and Cincinnati\\'s Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art. Hadid was the first woman to ever take home the Pritzker Prize, the architecture world\\'s highest honor, and was also the first woman to receive Britain\\'s esteemed RIBA Gold Medal. The Times points out that Hadid\\'s designs were often not the most practical (nor the cheapest): Her plans for the 2020 Olympics\\' main venue in Tokyo had to be ditched after anticipated costs blew up to around $2.5 billion, more than double the original estimate. But she came up during a time when architects morphed into celebrities, and she was one of the hottest and most imaginative of them all, cranking out such complicated theoretical designs in the beginning of her career that they were never able to be brought to fruition. \"Each new project is more audacious than the last and the sources of her originality seem endless,\" the Pritzker jury wrote upon awarding her its prize in 2004.

The crowd at the Family Research Council\\'s Values Voters Summit booed after Trump called the senator as a \"clown,\" although Trump, who went on to describe Rubio as \"weak on immigration,\" later claimed the boos were actually cheers, NBC reports. Trump\\'s comments followed a week of back-and-forth between the pair, with Rubio calling Trump \"very touchy and insecure guy\" and Trump describing his 44-year-old rival as an \"overly ambitious,\" excessively sweaty, \"kid\" who \"shouldn\\'t be running in this race,\" reports CNN. After the summit comment, Rubio retorted that Trump \"had a tough week\" and a \"really bad debate,\" reports the New York Times, which notes that Trump has attacked Rubio\\'s bank balance and even his hair. But Rubio is rising in the polls and unlike Jeb Bush, the target of many Trump attacks over the summer, it looks like the senator has a good instinct for Internet-driven political culture, and \"knows how to get under the reality TV master\\'s skin,\" writes Greg Sargent at the Washington Post. The Times notes that when a reporter asked Trump about John Boehner\\'s resignation yesterday, he didn\\'t have much to say, but when asked about Rubio, he criticized his absenteeism record in the Senate and called him a \"baby.\" (Trump was also booed by a crowd waiting for Pope Francis.)\\n',\n",
       " '– The co-founders of the dating app Tinder, along with eight other current and former executives, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against IAC/InterActiveCorp and its Match Group subsidiary for allegedly bilking them by manipulating financial information to create a lowball estimate of Tinder\\'s value, the AP reports. They are seeking at least $2 billion in the lawsuit against Match and IAC, which is controlled by media mogul Barry Diller. IAC and Match Group, of which Tinder is now part, called the allegations in the lawsuit \"meritless.\" The lawsuit claims that there were written contracts between IAC and Match and Tinder employees, including founders Sean Rad, Justin Mateen, and Jonathan Badeen. The contracts required Tinder be valued on specific dates in 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021 and that the workers be allowed to exercise their stock options and sell them to IAC and Match. The lawsuit alleges New York-based IAC and Match instead created false financial information, delayed new products, and used other tactics to try to keep Tinder\\'s valuation low. Per CNN, the dispute centers around a 2017 analysis that valued Tinder at $3 billion, the same valuation that had been set two years prior, despite the fact that both revenue and subscribers had increased in that time; the suit says the 2017 valuation, which was done to set a value for stock options received by Rad and other early employees, should have been higher. Tinder was then merged into Match Group, which the lawsuit says was a pretext to extinguish Tinder employees\\' stock options. \"They lied about the financial performance. They manipulated financial data, and essentially stole billions of dollars by not paying us what they contractually owe us,\" Rad tells CNN. In a statement, IAC and Match Group said Rad, Mateen, and other former execs \"may not like the fact that Tinder has experienced enormous success following their respective departures, but sour grapes alone do not a lawsuit make.\" See CNN for much more on the ins and outs of the suit, which also includes allegations of sexual harassment and groping against Tinder\\'s former CEO.\\n',\n",

SeaWorld didn\\'t immediately name the calf because the park\\'s veterinarians have not yet determined whether it is male or female. The mother, 25-year-old Takara, was already pregnant last year when SeaWorld stopped the breeding program. The gestation period for orcas is about 18 months. SeaWorld says the mother had a smooth delivery and both appear healthy. SeaWorld\\'s chief zoological officer, Chris Dold, tells the AP that the birth was one of those \"extraordinary moments.\" SeaWorld says the calf—one of a couple of dozen orcas that will remain in the company\\'s parks for decades to come—represents the last chance for visitors and researchers to witness the growth and maturation of a young orca outside its natural setting, the San Antonio Express-Tribune reports. There are two male orcas at the San Antonio park and SeaWorld thinks Kyuquot is the father, but it will carry out tests to make sure.

This time, she was grilling Marines chief Gen. Robert Neller in the wake of the revelation that photos and videos of female Marines, sometimes nude, had been widely shared in online groups. One exchange, via ABC News, sums it up: Gillibrand: \"It is a serious problem when we have members of our military denigrating female Marines who will give their life to this country in the way they have, with no response from leadership. So if you\\'re dedicated to fixing the culture of the Marines and all the services, what do you plan to do to hold commanders responsible who fail to get this done?\" Neller: \"I\\'m responsible. I\\'m the commandant. I own this, and we are going to have to, you know, you\\'ve heard it before, but we\\'re going to have to change how we see ourselves and how we do—how we treat each other. That\\'s a lame answer, but ma\\'am, that\\'s the best I can tell you right now. We\\'ve got to change, and that\\'s on me.\" The New York Times, meanwhile, has the story of one of the women victimized. Savannah Cunningham, a 19-year-old in Phoenix, made a nude video for a Marine she was dating in a long-distance relationship, and it surfaced in the online forums. Cunningham wasn\\'t in the military at the time, but, despite the harassment she endured over the video, ships out for basic training next month. “Someone needs to stand up and say this does not represent the values of the Marine Corps,” she tells the newspaper. “If not me, then who?” A story in the Navy Times shows the challenge: It confirms that the scandal is not confined to the Marines, with women from at least a dozen Navy commands also specifically targeted in the online forums, likely by other sailors.\\n',\n",

Central Command said US forces killed the militants using \"a combination of small-arms fire and precision airstrikes,\" with the primary goal being the collection of intelligence, reports the BBC. It was unclear what was retrieved on that front. The Defense Department, which did not mention any US casualties, said the operation was conducted with the support of Yemen\\'s government. The raid in Marib province is the second publicly known US ground deployment in Yemen this year against al-Qaeda. The first, in January, resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL. The United States also has stepped up airstrikes as part of a sustained assault on al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in areas of Yemen where it is most active. Washington considers AQAP one of the most dangerous branches of the terror network. The January raid killed 25 civilians, including women and children, and sparked outrage in Yemen. For its part, al-Qaeda has used the chaos of Yemen\\'s civil war to expand its footprint and recruitment efforts in the region.\\n',\n",
       " '– Being lonely won\\'t just make you feel sad—it may also endanger your life. In fact, researchers now say that people steeped in social isolation (including those who live by themselves) and a lack of connection with others can suffer just as much of a mortality risk as someone inhaling nearly a pack of cigarettes a day, and even more so than someone who\\'s obese, Seeker reports. All of which leads Julianne Holt-Lunstad—a Brigham Young University psychology professor who presented these findings, also published in the PLOS ONE journal, at the American Psychological Association\\'s convention on Saturday in DC—to stress that loneliness and isolation should be treated as public health issues. She says they could perhaps be partly remedied via initiatives such as teaching kids more social skills in school, or prepping seniors on how to keep their social lives active after they retire. Holt-Lunstad\\'s research was based on two meta-analyses. The first, comprised of 148 studies and nearly 300,000 subjects, found those who claimed better social connections also boasted a 50% lower risk of early demise—and poor social connectivity offered the same mortality risk as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. The second grouping was made up of more than 3.4 million participants over 70 studies and found that social isolation (lack of actual contact with others), loneliness (the perception of feeling lonely, whether others are around or not), or simply living alone all carried more risk of premature death than obesity. \"With an increasing aging population, the effect on public health is only anticipated to increase,\" Holt-Lunstad notes. \"Indeed, many nations around the world now suggest we are facing a \\'loneliness epidemic.\\' The challenge ... now is what can be done about it.\" (How loneliness and Alzheimer\\'s may be linked.)\\n',\n",

Spanish police have named the suspect as 18-year-old Moussa Oukabir, the Guardian reports. The suspect\\'s brother, 28-year-old Moroccan national Driss Oukabir, was arrested after the attack and reportedly told authorities that his identity documents, which were used to rent the van, were stolen. In other developments: Police say five suspects shot dead after injuring people in a second attack Thursday night were wearing fake explosive belts, CNN reports. The suspects engaged in a shootout with police after driving their Audi A3 into pedestrians in the town of Cambrils, authorities say. Their vehicle overturned during the attack. The suicide belts were so realistic that security forces didn\\'t know they were fake until controlled explosions had been carried out, authorities say. Investigators believe a 12-person terror cell was behind both attacks and an explosion that killed a person at a house in the town of Alcanar, the Telegraph reports. They suspect the terrorists were planning to use gas canisters in another attack. A counterterrorism expert tell the New York Times that authorities believe the attackers initially planned to use a large truck loaded with explosives, but they rented multiple smaller vehicles after they couldn\\'t get a permit for a larger one. Police say the three people arrested so far include a man from Melilla, Spain\\'s North African enclave, reports Reuters. A 7-year-old Australian boy is missing after the Barcelona attack, the Guardian reports. Family members are pleading for help in the search for Julian Cadman, whose mother was hospitalized in serious condition after the attack. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Spaniards \"are not just united in mourning, but especially in the firm determination to beat those who want to rob us of our values and our way of life,\" the AP reports. He has declared three days of national mourning. This is the latest atrocity in what the BBC calls a \"worrying trend\" of attackers using vehicles to attack \"soft\" targets.

It was an eight-second clip of her entitled \"The World\\'s Ugliest Woman,\" and to her horror it had more than 4 million views and what she says were thousands of nasty comments, the BBC notes. \"Why would her parents keep her?!\" one reportedly read. \"Kill it with fire,\" another commenter posted. It was in that moment that Velasquez, who has two rare conditions known as Marfan syndrome and lipodystrophy, realized how different she was perceived to be. \"I cried for many nights,\" she says, per the BBC. \"As a teenager, I thought my life was over.\" Far from it: Today, at the age of 26, Velasquez is an anti-bullying advocate and the subject of A Brave Heart, a documentary that debuted over the weekend at the SXSW festival. Velasquez\\'s conditions have caused physical problems throughout her life, including an inability to gain weight (she\\'s now 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 60 pounds or so), blindness in one eye and limited vision in the other, fatigue, and difficulty getting over sickness, the BBC reports. And the discovery of the YouTube video was painful—but the positive attitude her parents instilled in her helped her move past the hurt and even forgive the person who put the video up. Now Velasquez has her own YouTube channel with close to a quarter-million subscribers, has given a TED talk on defining your own beauty, and has joined with the mom of Megan Meier—a teen who killed herself after being bullied online—to lobby Congress for a federal anti-bullying bill. \"Her experience of triumphing adversity and making it to the other side of a painful experience is universal,\" the director of A Brave Heart tells the broadcaster.\\n',\n",

A major study commissioned by the US government found that diplomats suffered concussion-like symptoms, and many of them reported hearing strange noises before falling ill. Now, however, four separate letters by scientists in the US and several other nations are challenging that initial study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, reports the Guardian. The critics, writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association, say the Penn researchers misinterpreted results and too easily dismissed causes such as a \"mass psychogenic illness.\" The Penn researchers, meanwhile, are standing by their work and say additional research continues. Highlights: Psychological? Robert Bartholomew, a US scientist who works in New Zealand, makes the case for a \"mass psychogenic illness,\" also known as mass hysteria, reports BuzzFeed. The Cuban illnesses have all the hallmarks, he says, and he faults the Penn researchers for not investigating how closely the victims knew each other, and perhaps fed off each other in terms of symptoms. Inner ear: Another critic faults the first study for not focusing more on potential inner ear trouble. \"Almost all of the patients complained of hearing loss and balance problems,\" writes Gerard Gianoli of Louisana\\'s Ear and Balance Institute. “I do wish they would be more thoroughly evaluated.” Cognitive results: The Penn researchers found that some victims suffered cognitive damage, but another researcher thinks they\\'re wrong. The Penn scientists considered subjects \"impaired\" if they scored in the bottom 40% of tests; the more accepted benchmark would be closer to 5%.\\n',\n",

According to a study published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, there may be microbes living up to six miles under the seafloor. Researchers used a remotely operated vehicle to retrieve 46 samples of a rock called serpentine from a mud volcano near the Mariana Trench—the deepest place on Earth—southwest of Japan, Phys.org reports. According to Live Science, the serpentine may have originated more than 12 miles under the seafloor before being spewed out by the mud volcano. While the serpentine didn\\'t contain any actual microbes, researchers did find what National Geographic calls \"tantalizing traces of organic material.\" Due to the particulars of the subduction zone at the Mariana Trench, the researchers believe the microbes could have survived up to six miles below the seafloor before the pressure and heat became too much. They believe the organisms could survive on the methane and hydrogen produced when serpentine forms. \"This is another hint at a great, deep biosphere on our planet,\" study lead Oliver Plümper says.

To illustrate the massive growth another way: 10 days ago, the cryptocurrency market as a whole was worth $300 billion; now it\\'s above $400 billion, per CoinMarketCap.com. The quote of the day on the subject comes from Royal Bank of Scotland chair Sir Howard Davies, who called the whole situation \"irrational exuberance\" in comments to Bloomberg and warned, \"All the authorities can do is put up the sign from Dante\\'s Inferno: \\'Abandon hope all ye who enter here.\\'\" Per the Guardian, Davies couldn\\'t identify a \"rational reason\" for the rise, but CoinDesk shares the \"primary theory,\" which boils down to the fact that bitcoin futures will begin trading for the first time this month and \"big institutional money\" is getting in on the game.

The AP reports that shipments of cans of Gravy Train, Kibble \\'N Bits, Skippy, and Ol\\' Roy wet food have been pulled back after pentobarbital was found in nine of the 15 cans of Gravy Train that WJLA tested. The station, which commissioned a lab specializing in food testing for contaminants, also tested around two dozen other brands over several months, but there were no significant findings. People notes that Gravy Train is produced by the Smucker Co.\\'s Big Heart Pet Brands, which also makes Meow Mix, 9Lives, and Pounce pet edibles. The investigation was spurred after the death of a Washington state woman\\'s dog a year ago. All four of Nikki Mael\\'s dogs got sick on New Year\\'s Eve 2016 after eating canned Evanger\\'s dog food, and one, Talula, didn\\'t make it. Mael sent the food out for testing, and the lab found it contained pentobarbital, which is banned from use in pet or human food. Efforts are now focused on how the pentobarbital got into the Gravy Train samples, with the FDA jumping into the investigation; the AP notes a supplier that provides one of the brand\\'s lesser ingredients is being looked at. One somewhat stomach-churning possibility being bandied about: animals that were put down somehow ended up in the pet food. A rep from JM Smucker tells WebMD \"extremely low levels\" of pentobarbital aren\\'t risky for animals, but that \"the presence of this substance at any level is not acceptable to us and not up to our quality standards.\" (The FDA also warned about bones for dogs.)\\n',\n",

In what the BBC deems an \"unusual step,\" Facebook has some pushback on his words. \"When Chamath was at Facebook we were focused on building new social media experiences and growing Facebook around the world,\" a rep noted, adding Palihapitiya hasn\\'t worked there for years. \"Facebook was a very different company back then, and as we have grown we have realized how our responsibilities have grown, too.\" Palihapitiya hasn\\'t been alone in his advocate-turned-critic role.

The pic was taken at the Whigham Funeral Home in New Jersey, according to Enquirer editors, who have not revealed how it was obtained. \"Inside her private viewing,\" boasts a headline for the story, which says the singer was buried in $500,000 worth of jewelry, her \"favorite purple dress,\" and gold slippers. Houston\\'s nickname, \"Nippy,\" and two treble clefs are written in blue script on the white lining of the casket. The Washington Post\\'s Celebritolgy blog calls the Houston photo \"shocking and disturbing,\" while the Gossip Cop website says it \"represents the very worst of predatory paparazzi culture.\" The shot is not all that unique for the Enquirer. It infamously published a photo of Elvis Presley in his casket on its cover in 1977—and sold 6.5 million copies. Other media outlets weren\\'t particularly delicate about funeral coverage. AP streamed the entire funeral live—with permission from the family—while ABC News and Entertainment Weekly offered live blogs of the services (one commenter called EW\\'s live blog \"tacky\" and \"grotesquely inappropriate\"). CNN\\'s more-than-three-hour coverage of the services drew 5 million viewers.

The Daily Intel\\'s take: \"The speech itself was mildly received. There were a few moments of scattered clapping, some chuckling.

Also from the report: A blow-by-blow of Lanza\\'s carnage. The 20-year-old fired 154 shots, mostly in the classroom of substitute teacher Lauren Rousseau, where Lanza murdered her and 14 of her 15 students. He killed six more in the classroom of Victoria Soto, where student Jesse Lewis told kids to run when Lanza\\'s gun jammed. Six safely got past Lanza, but Lewis was killed. The Courant is posting interesting points from the report, including the fact that Lanza didn\\'t like holidays and birthdays, communicated with Nancy only by email for 3 months before the shooting, and had expressed an interest in serial murders and mass killings. Lanza was very interested in the Columbine shootings and posted a blog about them, NBC News reports. His mother Nancy stayed home to take care of him, saying he had Asperger\\'s Syndrome, but Lanza refused to take medication or behavioral therapy. He also felt no connection to Nancy and wouldn\\'t care if anything happened to her, according to a witness (Lanza killed her with a gunshot to the forehead). Lanza left his bed made at home and sealed his windows with duct tape. He had carefully taken apart his hard drive and scratched a \"W\" on the disks before trying to destroy them with a dumbbell. He changed the seven magazines he had on him so often that in some cases he fired off only half of a magazine\\'s 30 rounds before removing it; the Courant notes investigators see this as a sign he approached the school shooting like a video game, as typical gaming practice is to enter a new room with a full magazine.\\n',\n",

Though Chapman long defended her friend, refusing to name her publicly (she still hasn\\'t), she says they ultimately drifted apart. Chapman tells People her friend was \"distraught and depressed\" after the accident, and the two supported each other. \"The first year I made sure that she was OK, even more than me,\" Chapman tells Today. But as time went on, things shifted for both of them. \"She didn\\'t make the effort ... and every time we spoke, I just felt like I was remembering the accident ... and I had negative feelings.

At least some of the sites under consideration are in South Carolina, Kansas, and Colorado. The move would require up to $475 million in construction costs, though officials say closing Guantanamo will save $180 million per year. Annual operating costs for the US facilities would range from $265 million to $305 million. Since a law exists barring Guantanamo detainees from US soil, Congress would need to alter it to approve the plan. Critics say it would put Americans\\' safety at risk and the mayor of Leavenworth, Kan.—home to the maximum security Army prison under consideration for Guantanamo detainees—previously told NPR that she\\'s \"absolutely against\" Guantanamo prisoners moving there. Many locals in Canon City, Colo., home to the Centennial Correctional Facility also under consideration, feel similarly.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the launch \"the most serious and grave threat ever\" against his nation. Meanwhile, North Korean reports of the 1,680-mile missile flight over northern Japan lacked the typical bluster, per Reuters. The Hwasong-12 missile flew a shorter distance and at a lower trajectory than earlier launches before plunging into the sea.

That\\'s an estimated 3.7 billion people. The WHO had previously done the same assessment for herpes simplex virus type 2, aka genital herpes, and found that 417 million people ages 17-49 have it. HSV-1, by contrast, is transmitted by oral-oral contact (often via childhood kisses, notes NBC News) and causes cold sores. \"However, HSV-1 is an increasing cause of genital infection,\" they write, with the prevalence of genital HSV-1 being highest in the Americas. Reuters explains why: \"Improved hygiene in rich countries\" is reducing the number of infections that occur during childhood, and pushing more into young adulthood, where HSV-1 is transferred via oral sex (so not oral-oral but oral-genital). \"We really need to accelerate the development of vaccines against herpes simplex virus,\" one WHO medical officer says. There are currently multiple phase-1 and phase-2 trials, with Genocea Biosciences halting its work on a pneumonia vaccine to focus on genital herpes.

Among the night\\'s other key winners and losers: The National Republican Senatorial Committee finally had a great night after years of trouble against Democrats. They managed to knock out Sens. Mark Pryor, Kay Hagan, and Mark Udall, while keeping a struggling Pat Roberts in the Senate. As chair of the Republican Governors Association, another 2016 contender, Chris Christie, fought hard for important victories in Florida, Wisconsin, Maryland, and Illinois, USA Today reports. On a more conceptual level, the Huffington Post saw it as a big night for \"bullies.\" New York Rep. Michael Grimm beat out Domenic Recchia, even amid tax fraud charges and after a threat—caught on TV—to break a reporter \"in half.\" His win helped Republicans gain what ABC News notes is an even larger majority in the House. As for losers last night, President Obama was a big one: He earlier said that his \"policies are on the ballot.\" The results, then, were a \"near total repudiation\" of those policies, USA Today notes. What\\'s more, chances for a Democratic presidential victory in 2016 look weaker, the Huffington Post adds: The past three presidents have been elected under Congresses run by their parties. Wendy Davis lost badly in the Texas gubernatorial race. She wasn\\'t expected to win, Cillizza notes, but she was also an icon for those who hoped to see Texas eventually go blue.

       " '– A new post on a forum popular with ISIS militants claims the two Japanese captives are running out of time. The \"countdown has begun\" for the group to kill Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa unless Japan pays $200 million in ransom, according to the post, published today. Japan says it\\'s analyzing the message as it attempts to contact the men\\'s captors through local tribes, though ISIS\\' original 72-hour deadline has expired, the AP reports. \"The situation remains severe, but we are doing everything we can to win the release of the two Japanese hostages,\" government spokesman Yoshihide Suga says. Meanwhile, Goto\\'s mother, Junko Ishido, is pleading with the government to save her son, who \"only went to rescue his friend,\" Reuters reports. Documents show Japan considered a military strike on ISIS militants but found that one would be outside its legal realm. A Japanese journalist who tried to free Yukawa in September and an expert on Islamic law said yesterday they have an ISIS contact and were willing to negotiate with the group, the AP reports; it isn\\'t clear if Japan was agreeable. Finding the captors would be no easy task: Experts reviewing the hostage video—which seems to show Goto and Yukawa in jumpsuits in the desert—suspect it was actually shot in a studio, the AP notes. Shadows converge, indicating two light sources rather than one bright sun, while noiseless \"wind\" (perhaps from a fan) doesn\\'t appear to kick up dust. NHK reports ISIS will give a statement on the two captives \"soon.\"\\n',\n",

On second glance, they realized this was the shelter of three children, ages 11, 13, and 14, and their parents. Mona Kirk, 51, and Daniel Panico, 73, were charged with willful cruelty to a child Wednesday after authorities came upon the remote property without running water, electricity, plumbing, or heating, reports the Los Angeles Times. According to officials, the family had been staying at the desert property for four years, with Kirk and the children living in the box—about 20 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 4 feet high—and Panico living in the trailer or a vehicle, reports the San Bernardino Sun. Panico reportedly owned the property and planned to build his dream home there, a neighbor tells the Desert Sun. But the San Bernardino County Sheriff\\'s Department called it \"an unsuitable and unsafe environment\" for the children, who didn\\'t have an adequate amount of food. Authorities say the area, roamed by 30 to 40 cats, featured several feces-filled holes apparently used as toilets, and a rep for the sheriff\\'s department says the kids weathered nights as cold as 20 or 30 degrees. Kirk and Panico are now in jail with bail set at $100,000 each. Their children, who weren\\'t enrolled in public school, are in the custody of Children and Family Services and are in \"good spirits,\" per officials.\\n',\n",
       " '– Avocados are the frequent subject of teasing over their ever-so-brief period of ripeness—but one California company is looking to change that. Avocados treated by Apeel Sciences will be sold in the US for the first time this week, and thanks to a tasteless and edible coating, those avocados will stay fresh twice as long as a typical avocado. \"The average avocado might be ripe for 2-3 days. Ours will stay ripe for 4-6 days,\" says the company\\'s CEO, per the Guardian. The edible barrier, made from plant materials, creates a \"microclimate,\" controlling the rate at which water leaves the avocado\\'s surface and oxygen enters—the two main things that make produce go bad. Apeel\\'s CEO says it started with avocados because \"everyone has an experience of cutting into an avocado and discovering it’s past its prime. It’s a visceral reaction when you’ve spent a few dollars on something that ends up in the garbage.\" But many other types of produce can be treated with the coating, and Apeel hopes to ultimately help reduce the 400 pounds of food per person estimated to be thrown away in the US per year. Apeel-treated avocados are first rolling out in Costco and Harp Foods stores in the midwest, but will eventually be available across the US. They will cost the same as any other conventionally grown avocado. Business Insider has side-by-side comparison photos of an untreated versus a treated avocado 30 days after harvest.\\n',\n",

       " '– Well this gives the phrase \"sleeping like a log\" a whole new meaning. New research shows trees might sleep like any other living organism, the Christian Science Monitor reports. Scientists used lasers to make models of silver birch trees in Finland and Australia and discovered the trees\\' branches \"droop\" up to 10 centimeters at night, according to New Scientist. They published their findings earlier this year in Frontiers in Plant Science. Studies on flowers and other small plants undergoing changes between night and day go back centuries, according to a press release. But it was never clear if large plants like trees did the same thing. “No one has observed this effect before at the scale of whole trees, and I was surprised by the extent of the changes,” one of the researchers tells New Scientist. Researchers used laser technology that allowed them to monitor the trees\\' movements without using lights, which would have produced a photosynthetic response in the plants. They found the trees\\' branches were at their lowest point a few hours before sunrise. So far, it\\'s unclear if the trees were moving due to their own internal clock or because of reactions to photosynthesis during the day. The drooping could be attributed to the loss of water pressure inside plant cells at night or because it takes energy to hold branches up to the sun during the day. Researchers plan to next study the water use of trees during the day and at night to get a better idea of what\\'s going on. (If you\\'re a woman, trees could extend your life.)\\n',\n",

The pharmacy chain commissioned a study that found 41% of all people suffering persistent pain (and 66% of people aged 16-24) felt better after listening to music, reports the Telegraph. Now the store is \"trialing the use of music within our pain service in some of our pharmacies,\" says a company pharmacist. \"There are lots of different ways of managing pain, not only with medicines but also with lifestyle changes such as moderate exercise and relaxation,\" he says. The study of 1,500 people found pop music was the most effective pain reliever, followed by classical, then rock or indie music. The songs with the highest pain-relieving powers reported were \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" by Simon & Garfunkel, \"Angels\" by Robbie Williams, \"Albatross\" by Fleetwood Mac, \"Candle in the Wind\" by Elton John, and \"Easy\" by The Commodores.

       " '– A retired barber who murdered a urologist inside his Southern California office in 2013 over a 21-year-old grudge was sentenced Friday to life in prison plus 10 years without the possibility of parole, the Los Angeles Times reports. In 1992, Ronald Gilbert—then a medical resident at the veterans hospital in Long Beach—worked with other doctors to diagnose Stanwood Elkus, who was dealing with frequent urination, with a narrowing of the urethra. Two other doctors at the VA ultimately performed a simple urethra-widening surgery without Gilbert; Elkus firmly believed the surgery was botched and damaged his prostate, the Orange County Register reports, causing incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and diminished sex drive, all of which led his longtime girlfriend to leave him. A DA on the case told jurors that Elkus held a grudge against Gilbert over the incident. More than two decades later, Elkus—who had often seethed about his medical issues in the ensuing years \"to anyone who would listen,\" per the Register—used a fake name to make an appointment with Gilbert on Jan. 28, 2013, at his Newport Beach office, where he entered the exam room and shot him 10 times, killing him. The now-79-year-old pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, but jurors found that he was sane and convicted him last month of first-degree murder. Per KTLA, jurors also affirmed a special-circumstance allegation of lying in wait. That, along with a sentencing enhancement allegation of personal use of a gun, added 10 years to his sentence. \"The world was robbed of a model citizen … our children were robbed of an amazing father,\" said Elizabeth Gilbert, Ronald Gilbert\\'s wife, at the sentencing hearing, recalling her husband\\'s death just days before his 53rd birthday.\\n',\n",

Or more precisely, boy flies who get some action turn up their noses at food dosed with alcohol, while boys who get rejected are far more likely to indulge.

A federal jury has awarded each plaintiff $5 million in punitive damages and $75,000 in compensatory damages, Modern Farmer reports. The more than $50 million in awards is to be paid by Smithfield Foods—the company for which the North Carolina hog operation, Kinlaw Farms, raises the animals. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs complained of large pits holding hog feces that, in addition to causing horrible smells, attracted buzzards and insects. They say the sprayed feces sometimes even ends up in their homes, the Daily Press reports. Smithfield says it will appeal. The case, the ham giant says in a statement, is \"an outrageous attack on animal agriculture\" and that this and dozens of similar lawsuits—involving more than 500 neighbors in total—\"are a serious threat to a major industry, to North Carolina\\'s entire economy, and to the jobs and livelihoods of tens of thousands of North Carolinians.\" Modern Farmer points out that even if Smithfield loses its appeal, lawmakers with ties to the hog industry successfully put a limit on the amount of money plaintiffs can receive in this type of lawsuit, so the plaintiffs may ultimately only be able to collect $250,000 in punitive damages. The Wall Street Journal says it\\'s unclear whether the new state law will apply in this case.\\n',\n",

In a single press conference, Spicer managed to kill off the traditional way of reporting on a president, writes Margaret Sullivan at the Washington Post.

He says journalists should view Trump \"as a politician whose behavior is different only in degree, not in kind,\" noting that the Obama administration was no stranger to media manipulation.

The final version of a long-awaited report has removed a sentence that says fracking is not having a \"widespread, systemic impact\" on America\\'s water, the Christian Science Monitor reports. The report now leaves open the possibility that fracking could be having a major impact. \"While the number of identified cases of drinking water contamination is small, the scientific evidence is insufficient to support estimates of the frequency of contamination,\" EPA spokesman Thomas Burke tells the Wall Street Journal. \"Scientists involved with finalizing the assessment specifically identified this uncertainty in the report.\" The report had been in the works since 2010 and industry groups slammed the EPA for reversing course just before President Obama leaves office. Environmental groups, however, praised the agency for delivering a conclusion they said was based on science instead of political considerations. \"This report acknowledges what far too many communities across this country know to be true—fracking is a threat to our clean drinking water,\" Madeleine Foote of the League of Conservation voters tells the New York Times. \"Given EPA administrator nominee Scott Pruitt\\'s record of fighting fracking regulations, it will be important during the confirmation process for senators to ask him if he will follow the recommendations of the agency\\'s scientists, or continue to rely on industry spin.\" (The EPA shut down 17 wells after a strong quake in Oklahoma earlier this year.)\\n',\n",

Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, however, says he will never utter the man\\'s name, the Oregonian reports. \"I will not name the shooter,\" the sheriff told reporters at a Thursday night briefing in Roseburg. \"I will not give him credit for this horrific act of cowardice.\" The sheriff says the shooter is among the nine dead, and although he exchanged fire with deputies, it\\'s not yet clear whether he was killed by police gunfire or took his own life. In other developments: The father of a wounded student tells CNN that the gunman targeted Christians. He says his daughter has told him that after the shooter entered the classroom, students dropped to the ground and he told them to stand up if they were Christian. \"They would stand up and he said, \\'Good, because you\\'re a Christian, you\\'re going to see God in just about one second,\\'\" the father says. \"And then he shot and killed them.\" Mercer lists \"organized religion\" as one of his dislikes in a dating site profile where he describes his views as \"conservative, republican,\" reports the Daily Beast. His online presence also includes a Myspace page where he shows support for the IRA, and a blog in which he talks about Roanoke gunman Vester Flanagan. \"A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone,\" he writes. \"His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day.

The latest signal appears to be from a \"man-made source,\" says the head of the Australian agency coordinating the search, meaning it could be from the airplane\\'s black box recorders; it will be further analyzed overnight. It was picked up thanks to one of the dozens of \"sonobuoys\" dropped yesterday; they listen underwater and transmit data to aircraft. More reason to hope the plane will be found soon: CNN reports that the signals picked up over the weekend have been analyzed, and authorities say they likely did come from electronic equipment, not marine life, and they seem to be consistent with signals from a flight data recorder. Meanwhile, Malaysian sources have given CNN more details about the search and the plane\\'s final moments. They say: Police played the recording of the final words spoken from the cockpit to air traffic controllers for five Malaysia Airlines pilots who knew the pilot and co-pilot of Flight 370, and those pilots confirmed it was in fact the captain speaking. \"There were no third-party voices,\" one official source says. Sources add that there was no apparent stress, nor anything else unusual, in his voice. The plane vanished from military radar for about 120 nautical miles after crossing back over the Malaysian Peninsula, meaning it likely went as low as 4,000 feet.\\n',\n",

       " '– The cause of Sunday morning\\'s deadly train crash in South Carolina appears to be the most basic one imaginable: The Amtrak train that plowed into a parked freight train was on the wrong track, say state officials. Now the big question is how that happened. Two people are dead—the conductor and engineer aboard the Amtrak train—and more than 110 people injured, per the latest count from the AP. At least three of the injured were in serious or critical condition, and almost everyone else had relatively minor cuts or bruises. The Amtrak Silver Star from New York to Miami had been traveling about 50mph when it crashed into the empty CSX train, well within the 59mph speed limit for that stretch of tracks in Cayce, South Carolina, reports the State. The best guess at this point is that a switch in the wrong position sent the Amtrak train onto the wrong path. “Part of the preliminary indications are that it would have to be a switching issue,’’ says a state transportation official. \"It was no derailment caused by a flaw in the track. The Amtrak was on the wrong track.’’ He adds that CSX owns the track and would be the one responsible for maintaining the switches. Amtrak emphasized that point in its own statement, which also said it was \"saddened\" at the death of its two employees. NBC News reports that the Amtrak train received verbal permission to use the set of tracks because the CSX signals were offline for maintenance. The crash might have been avoided if the tracks had a safety system known as the Positive Train Control system, which sends warnings to trains ahead of a possible collision. PTC is being phased in around the country, but it\\'s not up and running yet on these tracks.\\n',\n",

Authorities were still piecing together the details of the case of veteran Border Patrol agent Juan David Ortiz, who allegedly killed four people and attempted to kidnap a fifth before his arrest over the weekend. The woman who escaped, a sex worker, told police that Ortiz, 35, picked her up on the street and took her to his home, reports the Corpus Christi Caller Times. She said he began acting \"weird\" when she kept talking about the recent murder of two other sex workers, one of them a friend. They left his home, and the woman, by now afraid for her life, made a break for it at a gas station, according to the police affidavit. Ortiz allegedly pulled a gun on her in his pickup truck, and she leaped out of the vehicle as he tried to grab her shirt. She then ran to a trooper at the gas station. Police arrested Ortiz hours later, at 2:30am, in a hotel parking lot, but they say he had killed two more women, also sex workers, in the interim, reports the Washington Post. One of the latter victims was transgender. Ortiz reportedly told investigators that he shot his first victim by the side of the road on Sept. 3 after a sexual encounter and the second after she accused him of being the last person to see the first victim alive. \"This guy is cold,\" says Webb County-Zapata County District Attorney Isidro Alaniz. Ortiz is a 10-year veteran of the US Customs and Border Protection, and authorities say he committed the murders while off duty.

We can thank Canadian grad student Yana Eglit, who took a dirt sample while hiking and found two microscopic species that have long proved impossible to classify, the CBC reports. \"They represent a major branch ... that we didn\\'t know we were missing,\" says Alastair Simpson, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax. \"There\\'s nothing we know that\\'s closely related to them.\" In analyzing her sample, Eglit spotted two kinds of minuscule organism called hemimastigotes—one of which had never been seen before. Scientists already know of roughly 10 hemimastigote species but haven\\'t been able to classify them. And no hemimastigote had ever undergone genetic analysis before. So Dalhousie researchers sequenced their genes using a new technique that gathers useful data from just a few cells, per Science Alert. The upshot: These organisms are as unlike other living things as fungi and animals are from one another. Technically they\\'re eukaryotes (possessing complex cells, like human beings) and protists (not within the fungi, plant, and animal kingdoms), but don\\'t fit patterns in the Eukaryota domain—so the Dalhousie team assigned them their own \"supra-kingdom.\" They also named the newly discovered hemimastigote Hemimastix kukwesjijk after an ogre from indigenous Canadian lore. After all, the tiny being has hairs and ruthlessly grabs its prey. The local Mi\\'kmaq people \"have an ogre-like creature [named Kukwes] who is also hairy and terrifying and eats other creatures,\" says Eglit.

At a rally Wednesday in Daytona Beach, Fla., Trump claimed the \"military tape\" purportedly showing \"money pouring off a plane\" had been released by Iran to \"embarrass\" the US. He again voiced the claim about the video during a Thursday rally in Portland, Maine, adding that Iran hoped to personally embarrass an \"incompetent\" President Obama with the video, the Los Angeles Times and CNN report.

It showed not a money swap but an AP clip of three US prisoners released by Iran and arriving in Geneva on Jan. 17. That led Trump to point out his own error on Twitter on Friday morning (though CNN notes he did so \"without actually saying he was wrong\"): \"The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!\" he tweeted.\\n',\n",

MacFarlane \"has no particular visual knack, little interest in storytelling, and nothing better to do with his naughty bear besides stuff him into a soft, sentimental comedy that seems almost proud of its lack of wit or conviction.\" The Globe and Mail is more forgiving: \"As unabashedly idiotic movie comedies go, Ted goes fairly well,\" the paper notes. \"It’s rude, crude, lewd, and often funny. In other words, it’s a lot like MacFarlane’s animated show transferred to the big screen in a live-action story.\" At Newsday, Rafer Guzman sees \"a very real heart\" to the film. \"This may sound silly, but the two humans and one bear make a pretty convincing dramatic triangle.\" Heart? David Haglund firmly disagrees. \"There’s a cruel edge to so much of MacFarlane’s comedy—the quintessential MacFarlane joke may be a punch in the face,\" he writes in Slate.\\n',\n",

The sheriff\\'s office said in a Facebook post that \"nothing of evidentiary value\" was found, though they have received more than 800 tips, CNN reports. Closs, 13, has been the focus of an intensive search since early Monday, when her parents were found shot to death in their home minutes after a cryptic 911 call was placed. The town of Barron, which has fewer than 3,500 people, has been deeply shaken by the murders and the disappearance, reports the Wausau Daily Herald. Police have said they don\\'t know whether it was a random attack or a targeted one. \"We don’t know anything and that’s hard,\" says Barron resident Cyndi Bragg. She says the community is \"stuck in limbo\" while the search continues—and she has told her own children to be extremely cautious. Fitzgerald has said he has a \"100% expectation that she\\'s alive,\" though there have been no credible sightings confirmed since her disappearance. The sheriff\\'s office says Jaymee is 5 feet tall and 100 pounds, with strawberry-blond hair and green eyes. (The sheriff believes Jaymee was home when her parents were killed.)\\n',\n",

The statue that Satanists wanted to erect outside Oklahoma\\'s Capitol building has found a more welcoming, but apparently temporary, home in Detroit. The 9-foot, 2,000-pound statue of winged, goat-headed idol Baphomet was unveiled just before midnight on Saturday at a private ceremony in a Detroit industrial building, where some of the crowd of hundreds shouted \"Hail Satan,\" reports Reuters. The Satanic Temple had sought to erect the statue in Oklahoma to protest the presence of a Ten Commandments monument and give the state a chance to show it espouses \"the basic freedoms spelled out in the Constitution.\" Detroit has more Satanists than most American cities, according to the Christian Science Monitor, though the director of the local chapter of the Satanic Temple says there\\'s a lot of confusion about what Satanism is, and the group\\'s website defines Satan not as a supernatural being but as \"a symbol of man\\'s inherent nature, representative of the eternal rebel.\" Hundreds of people attended a Catholic mass to protest the statue\\'s presence in the city. It\\'s expected to stay in Detroit while the Satanic Temple tries to get it erected in Arkansas, where another Ten Commandments monument is planned at the statehouse, the AP reports. (Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin has rejected a state Supreme Court ruling ordering the removal of the monument.)\\n',\n",

Her specialname.cn asks parents to pay a small fee, input their baby\\'s gender, and choose five personality traits, out of a dozen options, they hope their child will have. Teen entrepreneur Beau Jessup has assigned those personality traits to English names, and three are chosen, shared with the family, and printed on a certificate along with their meanings and a famous person who shares the name. Jessup has offered up more than 200,000 names and has made nearly $64,000 from the venture so far, the BBC reports. The website also offers a photo gallery where parents can add pictures of their babies, the Independent reports. She came up with the idea while on a family vacation in China, when she learned that Chinese parents make sure to give their babies English names in case they later study or work in the UK or the US, the Telegraph reports. Jessup was asked to pick an English name for the newborn baby of a family friend while on the trip, and after hearing some \"embarrassing\" English names that had been given to other Chinese babies, she stepped in and later came up with her website idea. \"Being exposed to luxury items and things like Harry Potter, Disney films, and Lord of the Rings means [Chinese parents] use those for reference,\" she explains. \"I once heard of someone called Gandalf and another called Cinderella.\" Jessup, who is studying Mandarin, is saving the money she earns for college tuition.

If no action is taken, the doctors warned, there won’t be any medical facilities left within a month. \"We do not need tears or sympathy or even prayers: we desperately need a zone free from bombing over eastern Aleppo to stop the attacks, and international action to ensure Aleppo is never besieged again,\" the doctors write. A medical facility in the rebel-held enclave is attacked every 17 hours, forcing the diminishing number of doctors to make horrifying choices such as which children will be provided with life-saving resources, they write, per the Guardian.

But he also finds much to enjoy, from \"the subplot of egotistical Gaston\" to the impressive detail in the computer imagery. In short, \"it is a visually sumptuous, highly watchable extravaganza.\" Sara Stewart actually thinks this new version is better than the original, partly because the Beast is \"more engaging.\" But the film as a whole \"has something for everyone,\" she writes at the New York Post. \"If you want your old favorite dressed in sumptuous new clothes, that\\'s what you\\'ll get.

Add this to Harvey\\'s toll: two ExxonMobil refineries, which sustained storm-related damage that facilitated the release of pollutants. The Washington Post has the details on the damage at the Baytown oil refinery, America\\'s second-biggest, and the Beaumont petrochemical refinery. NPR explains that the cleanup bill for Harvey could be as much as $100 billion, and while Congress will likely approve the funding needed, \"it probably won\\'t be easy.\" It explains why, and the waves in which the funding would be issued. The New York Times reports that a 12am to 5am curfew is now in place in Houston, and came partly in response to reports of \"small-scale looting.\" The Times puts the death toll at no less than 30.

At a city council meeting in Portland, Ore., on Wednesday, a man identifying himself as Carlos Enrique addressed Mayor Ted Wheeler, who is also the city\\'s police commissioner and has instituted new safety measures in response to angry protesters appearing at recent meetings, per KGW. Enrique told Wheeler he was amazed he could \"endure people coming and berating you every week,\" per the Portland Mercury. \"What I realized is that the language of resistance has not been properly translated to you. So this is for you,\" Enrique said, before walking up to Wheeler with a hand in his jacket. Rather than crack a smile like the officer in Pepsi\\'s yanked ad, Wheeler appeared alarmed as Enrique reached inside and pulled out a can of Pepsi. After setting the Pepsi in front of Wheeler, Enrique pulled out a second soda for himself, though he didn\\'t have time to take a sip before security officers approached him. \"Whoa whoa whoa, not a good move,\" Wheeler said. Once it was clear that no one\\'s safety was at risk, Wheeler did have a good laugh at the joke. But he also warned others in attendance not to approach the dais \"for your own safety,\" the Mercury reports. \"If this were the Boston City Council that would have ended differently,\" he added. \"Turns out Pepsi isn\\'t a panacea for everything,\" quips CNN.\\n',\n",

People with the condition, which comes on for seemingly no reason, have overly sensitive skin that reacts to sweat, tears, and even hot showers. According to WFTS, the painfully itchy hives Reid breaks out in can last for days on end; her blog features graphic pictures. Since developing cholinergic urticaria, Reid has lost her job and gained more than 100 pounds. She says she can\\'t go the store without getting horrible looks due to her hives. \"I used to be so beautiful; now I look like a monster,\" she tells WFTS. \"I just stay in bed and cry and cry.\" Reid says the Florida heat makes going out during the day impossible anyway. She says she\\'s depressed and barely bothers to get out of bed anymore. \"It\\'s torture living like this,\" she says. The condition is known to disappear as spontaneously as it comes, though there is no timeline. Doctors can provide antihistamines, but without a job or health insurance, Reid has a hard time paying for appointments. She\\'s hoping her plight will bring more attention—and hopefully a cure—to cholinergic urticaria. (Some people are allergic to vibrations, and scientists now think they know why.)\\n',\n",

An Iowa judge sentenced Eddie Tipton, 54, to up to 25 years in prison on Tuesday, though the Des Moines Register reports he could be paroled in as few as three due to Iowa law. \"I certainly regret\" what happened, Tipton told Judge Brad McCall, who cited Tipton\\'s \"greed\" in handing down the maximum sentence. As part of the deal, Tipton agreed to pay $2.2 million in restitution to state lotteries in Colorado, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Kansas; he was also accused of fixing games in Iowa, where he tried and failed to cash in a $16.5 million Hot Lotto ticket in 2010. When the judge asked him how he intended to pay the money back, Tipton said, per CNN, \"Initially, I really don\\'t know.\" As the information technology manager of the Multi-State Lottery Association, Tipton had access to computers that picked winning numbers in lotteries such as Powerball and Mega Millions in more than 30 states and US territories. He pleaded guilty in June to writing computer code that produced winning numbers on certain days; he then fed those numbers to accomplices, including his brother, who bought lottery tickets. The team then split the winnings. Tipton \"had the keys to the kingdom,\" the Iowa lottery CEO tells the AP, noting that \"checks and balances\" have been added to secure the drawings.

The \"resilient city\" remark apparently refers to an initiative by another prominent family, the Rockefellers, about which similar conspiracy theories abound.

Defense officials in Seoul say there has been activity around the North\\'s nuclear test site, but nothing out of the ordinary.

While it has long been known that African Americans pay more to keep their cars on the road, the analysis conducted by ProPublica and Consumer Reports questioned the insurance industry\\'s contention that premiums for liability insurance are determined by risk of accidents. After studying premiums and claims paid out in California, Illinois, Texas, and Missouri from 2012 to 2014, the nonprofits found that drivers in minority zip codes paid as much as 30% more than white drivers living in areas with similar risk. ProPublica says the \"disparity may amount to a subtler form of redlining,\" meaning denying services to minorities. In this case, many non-white drivers who need their cars to get to work are struggling to pay sky-high bills. One black driver, Otis Nash, pays $136 more each month than a white man living in an area of Chicago deemed a higher insurance risk. \"You just bite the bullet and go with it,\" Nash says. But California insurance regulators called the report \"flawed,\" and the insurance industry dismissed it as a \"weak\" oversimplification of the rate-setting process. \"There is no unfair discrimination, intentional or unintentional,\" says James Lynch of the Insurance Information Institute, per the New York Times. But ACLU attorney Rachel Goodman tells ProPublica the findings \"fit within a pattern that we see all too often—racial disparities allegedly result from differences in risk, but that justification falls apart when we drill down into the data.\" (A study found Walmart deliberately runs better stores in white areas.)\\n',\n",

That recommendation comes by way of Cornell University researchers, who have modeled the statistical mechanics of, yes, zombies and will present their findings at a meeting of the American Physical Society on March 5 in San Antonio. The researchers used a number of techniques that are used when modeling real diseases, and the abstract ends with this dismal line: \"We build up to a full scale simulation of an outbreak in the United States, and discover that for \\'realistic\\' parameters, we are largely doomed.\" But Phys.Org relays a glimmer of hope by way of Alex Alemi, a grad student involved in the research: He says those who want to remain safe from the undead for as long as they can should head to the northern Rockies. He explains that while books and movies typically show an outbreak touching all corners of the country immediately, \"in our attempt to model zombies somewhat realistically, it doesn\\'t seem like this is how it would actually go down.\" Yes, major cities could be toast within days, but less populated areas could be unaffected for weeks, and the northern Mountain Time Zone could be safe for months. \"Given the dynamics of the disease, once the zombies invade more sparsely populated areas, the whole outbreak slows down—there are fewer humans to bite, so you start creating zombies at a slower rate,\" says Alemi. \"I\\'d love to see a fictional account where most of New York City falls in a day, but upstate New York has a month or so to prepare.\" (Of course, some people want to be trapped in a room with a zombie.)\\n',\n",

Scullin, who made a separate 911 call, told the dispatcher it didn\\'t look like anyone had broken in. He says he grabbed his own daughter and Pleskovic\\'s son—WKYC notes the 18-year-old has Down syndrome—and went outside without surveying the scene more carefully. Scullin was set to marry Pleskovic\\'s daughter on the Saturday after the slaying, but instead he was said to have served as a pallbearer at her funeral.

In Soaked in Bleach, a private investigator named Tom Grant says he was hired by Love to find Cobain, who had gone missing, just a few days before his death, per the Consequence of Sound. The movie reportedly offers up convincing evidence from Grant that Cobain didn\\'t kill himself but was murdered, and that Love was the mastermind, Spin notes. The film also features commentary from Norm Stamper, who had just taken over as head of Seattle\\'s police force before Cobain died. While Stamper doesn\\'t come right out and say Love had her husband offed, he does think the movie\\'s allegations warrant a new look. \"We should in fact have taken steps to study patterns involved in the behavior of key individuals who had a motive to see Kurt Cobain dead,\" he says in the movie, per Spin. \"If in fact Kurt Cobain was murdered … and it was possible to learn that, shame on us for not doing that.\" And if he were still chief today, those steps would be taken, Stamper adds: \"It\\'s about right and wrong. It\\'s about honor. It\\'s about ethics. If we didn’t get it right the first time, we damn well better get it right the second time, and I would tell you right now if I were the chief of police, I would reopen this investigation.\" (The Montage of Heck documentary about Cobain has been described as \"brilliant\" and \"uncomfortable.\")\\n',\n",

His dad, Tom Rose, says the young man was working his first job and crossing the 520 bridge daily without a Good to Go pass—figuring he\\'d pay later, KING-TV reports. But the Washington State Department of Transportation didn\\'t have the son\\'s right address, so no bill came in the mail. The guy only learned of the $1,360 in tolls and over $16,000 in penalties when trying to sell his car. \"He was living hand to mouth,\" Rose says of his son. \"He thought he was picking the lesser of two evils. He could save up and pay for them later.\" Luckily WSDOT says it\\'s willing to strike a deal on the man\\'s penalties, but there are other cases of high Good to Go bills. In fact, a recent class-action lawsuit claims that Good to Go billing violated due process by not always notifying a driver of her outstanding bills and penalties, notes KING-TV. Other drivers have felt WSDOT\\'s billing wrath and learned they can\\'t complain in local courts, where elected judges might rule in their favor; billing complaints go to a \"merciless administrative review set up by the transportation agency itself,\" writes Danny Westneat in the Seattle Times. As for WSDOT, it has no comment on the lawsuit and says it hasn\\'t been served yet.\\n',\n",

Four American troops were killed in a rocket attack on a convoy near Bagram Air Base just hours after the Taliban office opened its doors in Qatar, the New York Times reports. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which came as Afghan forces formally took charge of the country\\'s security. In another setback for hopes of stability, President Hamid Karzai announced that the Afghan government was pulling out of talks on a new security deal with the US, the AP reports. The move is believed to be a protest at his government being sidelined by US-Taliban talks, though his official statement said only that the pullout was in response to the \"contradiction between acts and the statements made by the United States of America in regard to the peace process.\"\\n',\n",

Online merchandise sold out within hours, reports AP, while most shoppers at physical stores ended up out of luck. Those in the latter camp shouldn\\'t feel too bad about it, writes fashion critic Robin Givhan at the Washington Post. Lilly Pulitzer is a mass marketer of clothes, not fashion, she writes. And \"the clothes are, upon close inspection, not so terribly attractive.\" In fact, \"they are rather unattractive,\" writes Givhan. \"And that is part of their charm. They are not meant to be stylish—that’s so nouveau. The clothes are clubby. Country clubby. One-percent-ish.\" Remember that the company itself was created by a bored Palm Beach socialite—she died in 2013—and its summer dresses reflect that. \"The classic Lilly Pulitzer dress comes in shrill shades of yellow and pink that are vaguely infantilizing. They are clothes that can be shrunk down and worn by 7-year-old girls without changing a single design element—if there were actual design elements to change. But there are not.\" Those disappointed Target shoppers may be cursing their luck at missing out on bargain prices for what they think is high fashion. But really, they just got swept up in a this-many-people-can\\'t-be-wrong phenomenon. Target again proved it\\'s \"a retailing dynamo,\" writes Givhan. \"But what it was selling this time had nothing to do with fashion.\" Click for her full column.\\n',\n",

The woman told officers her 10-year-old daughter was still inside apartment number 808 from which they had escaped. What the officers didn't know was that the child was already dead, her battered and dismembered body partially wrapped in a blanket and set ablaze. With the fire alarm blaring, they busted in the front door and searched the smoke-filled apartment for Victoria Martens. In the bathroom, the real crime began to come into focus, the AP reports. Investigators took into custody the girl's mother, her boyfriend, and his cousin. The community was left struggling to understand how a blossoming elementary school student who loved swimming and gymnastics could have been the target of such violence. Details of what New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and law enforcement officials described as an unspeakable crime emerged in a criminal complaint made public Thursday. Police said Victoria was injected with methamphetamine, sexually assaulted, strangled, and stabbed before being dismembered Wednesday—her 10th birthday. The girl's mother, 35-year-old Michelle Martens, her 31-year-old boyfriend, Fabian Gonzales, and his 31-year-old cousin, Jessica Kelley, face charges of child abuse resulting in death, kidnapping, and tampering with evidence. Gonzales and Kelley also face charges of criminal sexual penetration of a minor. Martens told police she met Gonzales online about a month ago and that he drugged the girl so he could calm her down and have sex with her, the complaint says. Per KOB, Martens says Gonzales then strangled the girl and Kelley stabbed her in the chest.\\n\",\n",

A senior administration official tells Politico that President Trump once again chose not to reinstate the sanctions that were suspended as part of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Friday was the deadline to do so. However, Trump apparently warned it would not happen again. “The president makes clear this is the last such waiver he will issue,” an official tells the Washington Post. The next deadline for reinstating the sanctions against Iran is in May, and the official says Trump will do so and remove the US from the nuclear deal at that time unless European allies agree to changes to the deal meant to permanently stop Iran from building nuclear weapons. Those changes include adding \"triggers,\" such as inspections of Iranian facilities, and removing \"sunset clauses\" that allow Iran to enrich uranium and more. While not reinstating sanctions related to the nuclear deal, Trump did impose new sanctions on 14 Iranian people and organizations in response to recent violence against protesters there.\\n',\n",

That means the logo, which has been used since 1947 but is today deemed racist by Native American groups and others, will be seen on the team's uniforms for just one more season. However, the team will continue to sell merchandise adorned with Chief Wahoo in northeast Ohio, a decision the AP says was made to keep trademark rules in place. The move came after negotiations with Major League Baseball, which considers the logo inappropriate, reports the New York Times. The issue had come to a head in recent years as the Indians turned into a powerhouse team in the league and thus drew more attention. In fact, the team had been taking steps to limit the logo's exposure in recent years, notes Cleveland.com. For instance, Chief Wahoo is not displayed during the team's spring training camp in Arizona, out of respect for the area's Native American population.

The site of his resting place had been the subject of a legal fight ever since archeologists discovered his remains underneath a parking lot in Leicester in 2012. Though initial plans called for him to be reburied in the nearby Leicester Cathedral, a group of far-flung relatives sought to have him reburied in York instead, where he grew up. Today, judges at the Royal Courts of Justice rejected the idea. \"We agree that it is time for Richard III to be given a dignified reburial, and finally laid to rest,\" they wrote. But they found no compelling reason to move him to York. Richard died on the battlefield in 1485, the last English king to do so, notes the Guardian. By the looks of it, he then got unceremoniously dumped into a too-small grave, where he remained for nearly 530 years. The LA Times notes that scholars remain divided over Richard himself: He\\'s either the \"bloodthirsty tyrant\" as depicted by Shakespeare or \"an enlightened ruler\" whose reputation got maligned by the Tudor dynasty that succeeded him. Either way, he had a bad case of roundworms when he died.\\n',\n",

The marathon should boost Paul\\'s 2016 prospects; he proved he has \"a) a core set of beliefs and b) a willingness to stand up for them. That\\'s a rare thing in modern American politics.\" \"Rand Paul is giving a tutorial on what it means, or should mean, to be a member of the US Senate,\" writes Peter Beinart at the Daily Beast. Not only is he reviving the old-fashioned filibuster, \"he\\'s doing so on a matter of principle, not partisanship.\" Paul himself said yesterday that he \"would be here if it were a Republican president doing this,\" pointing out that Obama\\'s position mirrored George Bush\\'s. \"If only his reasoning matched the showmanship,\" laments the Wall Street Journal in an editorial today, arguing that Paul was overstating matters; yes, US citizens can be killed on US soil, but only if they\\'re enemy combatants. \"If Mr. Paul wants to be taken seriously he needs to do more than pull political stunts that fire up impressionable libertarian kids in their college dorms. He needs to know what he\\'s talking about.\" But Kevin Williamson at the National Review disagrees. \"Our definition of \\'enemy combatant\\' is terrifyingly elastic,\" he writes. He believes Paul \"performed a national service\" yesterday. Of course, Williamson would agree; Paul quoted his articles in his speech. It was nice, he writes, \"though my experience with senators suggests that they are impervious to argument, reason, evidence, and most other instruments save votes and campaign donations.\" Even Jon Stewart praised Paul. \"He\\'s using the filibuster the way it\\'s meant to be used,\" Stewart said on the Daily Show. \"I can\\'t say I agree with Rand Paul about everything, but as issues go, drone oversight is one certainly worth kicking up a fuss for.\"\\n',\n",

It\\'s called a \"leap second,\" and this will be the 26th one since the 1970s. The problem is that the last time this happened, in 2012, it caused all kinds of problems for all kinds of websites. \"If a computer sees the same second twice in a row, it logically thinks something went very wrong,\" explains Gizmodo. \"There are fixes to this, but they\\'ve obviously not been implemented across the board.\" Google has developed a work-around in which it \"gradually adds milliseconds to its system clocks prior to the official arrive of the leap second,\" reports the Telegraph, though it\\'s not clear whether other sites will follow suit. Meanwhile, the US is pushing for the end of leap seconds altogether, given their potential to wreak havoc with financial transactions, navigation, and communication in general.

About 1.8 billion children worldwide—that would be 93%—breathe air so toxic that it puts their health, their physical development, and their intelligence at risk, reports the Guardian. In poorer nations, a staggering 98% of children under the age of 5 are exposed to PM2.5, one of the most harmful pollutants, in levels that exceed the WHO\\'s safety guidelines. The pollution isn\\'t always of the outdoor variety: The burning of wood or paraffin for heating, cooking, and light also takes a toll, especially in poorer nations.

At this point, it\\'s old news that sitting for long periods of time is bad for your health. But who knew it could be this deadly?

The highest amount of sitting-related deaths were in the Western Pacific and parts of Europe, AFP reports.

Using public documents, CNN estimates the cost for the entire security team—not counting training, travel, or gear—at $2 million per year, prompting some members of Congress to ask if this is a \"potential waste or abuse of taxpayer dollars.\" The reason, especially considering no other EPA head has ever received 24/7 protection: The EPA is a \"lightning rod,\" and Pruitt is paying the price for it, per the agency\\'s inspector general\\'s office, which says it\\'s investigated more than 70 threats against Pruitt so far.

(As Carly Fiorina did in the early debate.) In fact, Trump fielded the very first question, and it was a doozy. When all the candidates were asked if anyone was unwilling to pledge support to the eventual nominee and to rule out a run as an independent, only Trump raised his hand. “I will not make the pledge at this time,” he said.

For people to want to just tune him out, they’re making a mistake.\" He also gave an impassioned answer about his support of gay marriage, here. Writes Nicholas Confessore at the New York Times: \"I think Kasich has been extremely effective up there. Lots of confidence, talks like a real person, and so far has successfully defended his biggest vulnerability--the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\" Rubio: “How is Hillary going to lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck.\" Rubio generally won praise tonight for his answers. Trump on political correctness: \"I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct. I’ve been challenged by so many people and I don’t, frankly, have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn’t have time, either.\" Carson: He said Hillary Clinton \"counts on the fact that people are uninformed.\" At another point, he thanked the moderator for a question and added, \"I wasn\\'t sure I was going to get to talk again.\" Cruz: “It’s not a question of stupidity.

It\\'s not clear what the complaint involved but in a statement, Subway said the company regrets that it was \"not properly escalated or acted upon.\" Subway says the 2011 complaint was the only complaint it found about its former pitchman in a thorough review of more than a million customer comments, as well as \"all available documents, and interviews with past and present Company and Franchisee Advertising Fund employees and management,\" People reports.

But as CNET reports, the Internet was far more interested in what Zuckerberg revealed inadvertently: His laptop is in the background, and it shows that Zuckerberg puts a piece of tape over its camera as an apparent security measure—to ward off hackers who might gain control of it remotely to spy on him. A Twitter user named Chris Olson seemed to be the first to spot it, tweeting on Tuesday that Zuckerberg also tapes over his microphone jack and uses a rather obscure email client from Mozilla called Thunderbird. (Some think it\\'s actually a Cisco VPN client.) Reaction: Gizmodo: \"Of course, it’s not insane that one of the most powerful people in the world is paranoid about being watched—but Zuckerberg better hope the legions of users his company is depending on for live video content don’t take a lesson from his book.\" New York Times: “Covering the camera is a very common security measure,” a security expert tells the newspaper. “If you were to walk around a security conference, you would have an easier time counting devices that don’t have something over the camera.” Fusion: Covering the camera is a wise idea. But \"putting tape over your microphone jack is not going to be effective in making your computer hacker-proof. That’s just going to keep someone from plugging their headphones into your machine. If Olson is wrong, and Zuck has in fact put tape over the mic holes, though, that will muffle the computer’s hearing ability, per a test conducted in our office.\" NPR: The Zuckerberg story is prompting outlets to re-run this quote from FBI chief James Comey in April: “I put a piece of tape—I have obviously a laptop, personal laptop—I put a piece of tape over the camera. Because I saw somebody smarter than I am had a piece of tape over their camera.” Also prior to the Zuckerberg story, the Guardian looked into the growing popularity of the idea.

       " '– In the US, women and girls sometimes donate their hair to groups that make wigs—think Locks of Love—not because hair is hard to come by but because it is so expensive. But many also buy wigs and extensions made of real human hair—and chances are good that hair comes from countries like India and China, where women sell their long locks out of necessity. It\\'s a dirty business, reports Alex Mayyasi for Priceonomics, both literally and figuratively. In India, for instance, sites like the Venkateswara Temple do quite a business selling hair (though they say they donate the proceeds to charities) because it is customary for pilgrims who visit the temple to have their heads shaved. Most are unaware their hair is sold. The workers who then sort through the discarded locks must contend with blood from the quickly-shaved scalps, lice, and more, and the factories reek. As Scott Carney wrote in his 2010 report for Mother Jones, \"Put 21 tons of the stuff in a room blooming with mildew and fungus and the stench is overpowering.\" Most say hair from India is the best; Mayyasi writes that Indian pilgrims typically haven\\'t performed damaging treatments on their hair, \"but its most valuable attribute is that it closely resembles caucasian hair.\" There\\'s a dark side to the trade, and not just the flow of hair from poor women giving up their long locks for wealthy buyers. There are stories of men beating and holding down women to shave their heads for money. Wigs made of real hair can easily cost thousands of dollars, though synthetic hair—which just doesn\\'t look as natural and can\\'t be styled—continues to improve and is far less expensive, so it may only be a matter of time before the market for the real thing dwindles considerably.

       " '– Just a week after scientists reported evidence that our species left Africa earlier than we thought, another discovery is suggesting the date might be pushed back further. Homo sapiens arose in Africa at least 300,000 years ago and left to colonize the globe. Scientists think there were several dispersals from Africa, not all equally successful. Last week\\'s report of a human jaw showed some members of our species had reached Israel by 177,000 to 194,000 years ago. Now comes a discovery in India of stone tools, showing a style that has been associated elsewhere with our species. They were fashioned from 385,000 years ago to 172,000 years ago, showing evidence of continuity and development over that time. That starting point is a lot earlier than scientists generally think Homo sapiens left Africa. This tool style has also been attributed to Neanderthals and possibly other species. So it\\'s impossible to say whether the tools were made by Homo sapiens or some evolutionary cousin, say researchers who reported the finding Wednesday in the journal Nature. \"We are very cautious on this point\" because no human fossils were found with the tools, several authors added in a statement, per the AP. Michael Petraglia, an archaeologist who specializes in human evolution in Asia but didn\\'t participate in the work, said he did not think the tools show that our species had left Africa so long ago. \"I simply don\\'t buy it.\" Instead, he said, he believes one of our evolutionary cousins in India developed the tool style independently. \"It\\'s a whodunit, and we don\\'t have the answer,\" a paleoanthropologist not involved with the study tells NPR.\\n',\n",

Leon Wolf at RedState, however, calls Cruz the winner simply because the debate left him on course to become Trump\\'s sole opponent.

Washington State University and the Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance worked on it with a $40 million federal grant from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The jet fuel containing wood products is rated as equivalent to regular jet fuel, the Seattle Times reports. If all of Alaska Airlines\\' planes at Sea-Tac saw 20% of their fuel replaced with the biofuel, it would reduce carbon emissions equal to those produced by 30,000 cars per year, but more funding is needed before the fuel can be used regularly because it\\'s currently more expensive than jet fuel.\\n',\n",

Should Kagan, 50, be confirmed, the high court would have three female justices for the first time. Her nomination marks the first time in 38 years that a Supreme Court nominee was not a sitting judge, notes the Washington Post.

       " '– Kim Kardashian was the latest celebrity paid ($500,000, in this case) to escort Austrian businessman Richard Lugner to the Vienna Opera Ball last night, but the evening didn\\'t exactly go as planned. Sources tell TMZ Kardashian was posing for pictures with Lugner when a worker approached her in blackface, pretending to be Kanye West. She stayed at the ball, but then another man asked her to dance—and when she tried to decline, the guy told her the orchestra should play \"N-----s in Vienna\" for them to dance to, and she stormed out of the event. Prior to the ball, Lugner complained to reporters that \"Kim is annoying me, because she\\'s not sticking to the program,\" Radar reports. Hours after Kardashian arrived in Vienna, with mom Kris Jenner and daughter North West in tow, Lugner says she stood him up to go film scenes for Keeping Up With the Kardashians. \"The guest should be with me and not anywhere else that is not agreed upon,\" said 81-year-old Lugner. But Kardashian had her own complaints, sources say: She claims Lugner grabbed her aggressively and was attempting to get alone with her. At least Kardashian showed up for the escort gig: In 2010, Lindsay Lohan bailed.\\n',\n",

That confirmed earlier reports that Joe Gliniewicz had killed himself, but what emerged at the presser was more shocking: that Gliniewicz had taken his own life after committing criminal acts, the AP notes. \"Gliniewicz committed the ultimate betrayal to the citizens he served and the entire law enforcement community,\" Filenko said, per the Daily Beast, adding that the police officer had \"intentionally left a staged trail of police equipment at the crime scene.\" Filenko tells the Daily Herald that the popular officer known as \"GI Joe\" stole and laundered somewhere in \"the five figures\" from the department\\'s Explorer program—a training program for youth interested in a career in law enforcement—using it \"as his personal bank account.\" Gliniewicz allegedly used the funds for gym memberships, travel, his mortgage, and adult websites. What helped crack the case: electronic messages deleted from his work and personal cellphones, Filenko adds. There were questions about Gliniewicz\\'s death almost from the start, including that the fatal bullet had come from his own gun, as well as an initial refusal by the coroner to rule out suicide or an accident, CNN and the Daily Beast note. Now Filenko may have to walk back angry statements he made about the coroner—as well as justify the estimated $300,000 price tag for the manhunt.\\n',\n",
       " '– A fun day snowmobiling in British Columbia left one man with \"horrific\" injuries and another liable for them after he was thrown off his snowmobile and the vehicle kept going, slamming into one of his companions. InfoTel News reports that Devon Webb, Angelo Passerin, and about eight others were snowmobiling after lunch in McBride on March 22, 2013, when Webb\\'s sister, Sarah, became stuck in the snow, per a lawsuit filed by Passerin. Passerin saw her waving for help and went to assist, when suddenly a riderless snowmobile came out of nowhere and struck him down. It turned out Devon Webb had been thrown from his snowmobile, which then \"traveled over a 100-foot cliff, climbed out of a 20-foot powdered ravine, and raced at full throttle for [0.6 to 0.9 miles] until it struck Mr. Passerin,\" the suit notes. It only stopped after slamming into Sarah Webb\\'s snowmobile. The crash left Passerin with broken leg bones and vertebrae, a brain injury, and a limp now with him for life, the CBC reports. Webb was found liable because he wasn\\'t wearing the tethered safety cord that should be hooked to each rider\\'s clothing; if the rider falls off, the cord, attached to a cap on the snowmobile, yanks off the cap, which shuts the vehicle off. Supreme Court Justice Dev Dley found Webb had neglected to put his tether on, bucking precautions that would\\'ve kept his friend safe. Although Webb tried to argue that Passerin had been drinking—the latter had a vodka cranberry with his lunch, while Webb had consumed no alcohol—the judge found \"no evidence\" Passerin was impaired to the point where he could\\'ve avoided being hit by the runaway snowmobile. Both Passerin and Sarah Webb said they hadn\\'t heard the snowmobile coming.\\n',\n",
       " '– An 18-year-old San Francisco-area transgender teen may be the first to have had eggs harvested prior to transition. Having decided last year to go from Nicole to Cole Carman, the teen decided to harvest his eggs first so it would be easier to have his own biological children down the road. \"I\\'ve always known I wanted to have kids of my own, so ... it was a no-brainer,\" he tells Yahoo Parenting. Typically these procedures are performed when trans males are in their 30s, already transitioned, and decide to halt their testosterone so that they can be biologically related to their kids, says Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, who performed the successful procedure on Carman. But post-transition is far more challenging: \"After years of testosterone therapy, their ovaries would shut down and would not reawaken to create any viable eggs, or the eggs would be low quality.\" Carman\\'s parents, who adopted their only child when he was just 5 weeks old and know how hard it can be to conceive, funded the procedure themselves, paying $13,000 to have the eggs harvested in May. \"I didn\\'t really hesitate at all simply because Cole has always been mature in his thinking and I knew this was something that was really important to him,\" his mother tells People. Carman has reportedly been thinking about his gender, as well as what it means to be trans, since he was 12, and Eyvazzadeh says she wanted to help \"from the minute\" they met. \"I could tell that he was mature, he knew exactly what he wanted and this was self-directed,\" she says. \"It\\'s not something you do on a whim.\" (Caitlyn Jenner is shocking some of her trans friends with her politics.)\\n',\n",

The company announced Wednesday that once activated, Snap Map places a location Bitmoji on the new map feature for anyone on a user’s friends list to see. But according to the Verge, locations update whenever the app is opened, meaning friends can track users’ whereabouts more often than they may realize. Writer Dani Deahl tested out how much information she could gather via the map by observing a friend’s Bitmoji. Within minutes, she was able to guess her friend’s address, which she hadn’t previously known. “That’s so creepy!” her friend said after Deahl called to confirm the address, adding, “I wouldn’t want people to see where I am at all times.” The map function is opt-in and users can go into a “ghost mode” to turn it off, but a social media expert told ABC 15 that parents should make sure their children understand how it all works: “It\\'s OK to pretend that you don’t understand, even if you might understand a little bit, get them to explain it to you to make sure they understand.” Meanwhile, the Telegraph reports that police in the UK have already issued warnings to parents on the dangers of location sharing, echoed by UK Safer Internet Centre, which cautions that the new feature \"can allow people to build up a picture of where you live, go to school, and spend your time.” The Verge writes that to opt out, new Snapchat users should choose ghost mode, and those who already opted in can switch to ghost mode in the map\\'s settings to disable the location feature.\\n',\n",

       " '– Mystery solved: Scientists say they\\'ve finally figured out why Old Faithful erupts with super-hot water and steam about every 90 minutes, Our Amazing Planet reports. Seismic records show that under the Yellowstone geyser, a large egg-shaped chamber is connected to the mouth of Old Faithful by a sort of pipe. After every eruption, water levels rise in the chamber and send steam bubbles into the conduit—which creates a \"bubble trap\" that leads to the eventual steam explosion. What\\'s the big deal? The finding helps discredit an old idea that large geysers are fed by long, narrow tubes (Our Amazing Planet describes Old Faithful\\'s \"plumbing [as] more like a bagpipe than a flute\"). Researchers made a similar finding earlier this year in Russia, where geysers are also fed by caverns that create bubble traps. Another neat fact: Scientists were able to map Old Faithful\\'s cavern with seismic records because gas bubbles create tremors when they pop. And there\\'s good news for those eager to visit it: Sequestration forced the park to postpone its annual snow-plowing efforts, pushing the opening date to April 26; but the Billings Gazette reports that the road to Old Faithful opened Friday, due to a happy combination of good weather, less snow than expected, and help from the state\\'s Department of Transportation.\\n',\n",

       " '– Researchers in London think they have solved one of the most enduring mysteries of Stonehenge: How did a bunch of prehistoric Britons haul massive stones from a quarry in Wales to the site of the monument more than 100 miles? \"The answer,\" per the Telegraph, \"is surprisingly simple.\" By mounting a giant stone on a wooden sleigh and dragging it along a track of timbers, a team from University College London found that just 10 people were able to move a more than 2,000-pound stone at a rate of about 1mph. “We were expecting to need at least 15 people to move the stone so to find we could do it with 10 was quite interesting,” doctoral student Barney Harris tells the Telegraph. The rocks in question, the ones at the center of the monument known as bluestones, were quarried in Preseli hills in Pembrokeshire, Wales, according to a separate study last year. They were laid at Stonehenge, some 140 miles away in Wiltshire, around 2400 BC, according to Seeker.com. The larger stones around the perimeter, called sarsens, are local sandstone and were laid during a second phase of construction about 500 years later. The sleigh-and-track method, if that\\'s what Stonehenge\\'s architects used, is not unique, Harris tells the Telegraph. “We know that pre-industrialized societies like the Maram Naga in India still use this kind of sledge to construct huge stone monuments, he says, adding that the Japanese are known to have used similar sleighs thousands of years ago. Could oxen have been used to pull the stones along the track? \"Oxen are quite belligerent and difficult to control,\" Harris says. \"This experiment shows that humans could have carried out the task fairly easily.\" (A century ago, Cecil Chubb bought Stonehenge on a whim.)\\n',\n",
       " '– Scientists say they\\'ve discovered \"one of the safest and the easiest approaches to convert poor learners to good learners.\" And all you have to do is eat cinnamon. Researchers at Rush University Medical Center say that feeding cinnamon to mice with a poor learning ability turned them into a bunch of brainiacs by transforming the part of the brain that controls memory. Previous research has found poor learners have less of a protein vital to memory and learning, known as CREB, and more of a protein known as GABRA5 in the hippocampus. However, poor-learning mice showed increased CREB and decreased GABRA5 after a month of daily cinnamon doses, study author Kalipada Pahan explains in a release. Essentially, the body converts cinnamon into sodium benzoate, which promotes healthy neurons, reports the Epoch Times. The mice were then able to navigate a maze in half the time it took them before, even though the exit moved with each test. The ability was similar to that of so-called good-learning mice. Mice who were given cinnamon but were already good learners, however, didn\\'t exhibit any change. \"We have successfully used cinnamon to reverse biochemical, cellular, and anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with poor learning,\" says Pahan, adding \"if these results are replicated in poor learning students, it would be a remarkable advance.\" Interestingly, Pahan notes cinnamon is superior to straight doses of sodium benzoate because the chemical is slowly released from cinnamon but is \"quickly excreted out through the urine\" when taken on its own. (This doesn\\'t mean you should take the cinnamon challenge.)\\n',\n",

Harry Shearer—perhaps better known as the guy who voices dozens of Simpsons characters—co-created the 1984 film along with Rob Reiner, Michael McKean, and Christopher Guest and also co-wrote its soundtrack and starred as bassist Derek Smalls, reports Variety. He claims the four creators were promised 40% of net receipts from all sources of revenue, but he accuses Vivendi—which acquired the rights to the film in 1989—of a \"concerted and fraudulent campaign to hide, or grossly underreport, the film\\'s revenues in order to avoid its profit participation obligations,\" per the Guardian.

At least two fires were triggered when a diesel leak exploded at the Richmond refinery, one of the largest in the nation, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. There were no fatalities and no one was seriously injured. The plant was evacuated after workers spotted the leak. Minutes after the explosions, plant alarms alerted nearby residents to stay indoors with doors and windows shut to avoid breathing toxins in the air. Residents in all of Contra Costa County in the East Bay were being told to stay inside as hazmat trucks drove through streets taking air samples. Health officials, concerned about fumes from crude oil and diesel fuel, said that so far the winds seem to be carrying most of the smoke skyward. Dozens of people complaining about breathing problems headed to local emergency rooms. One patient with a burning throat and sore, itchy eyes, told the Chronicle: \"They told me I\\'m not going to die, but it sure feels pretty serious.\" The fire was contained late last night as a crew of 60 firefighters battled the blaze with nitrogen and steam to keep it cool, but Chevron officials offered no estimate as to when the fire would be extinguished, NBC reports.

According to People, Reet Jurvetson, 19, flew from Canada to LA in 1969 to see a man named Jean she met in a Montreal coffee shop. Weeks later, she was dead—stabbed 150 times. Jurvetson\\'s body was found on Mulholland Drive, near where Sharon Tate and four others had been stabbed to death by the Manson family a few months earlier. One Manson prosecutor believes Jurvetson was killed because she witnessed another killing, but no solid evidence has ever tied her death to the Manson family. Jurvetson\\'s family never filed a missing persons report, figuring she had started a new life in the US, and Jurvetson wasn\\'t even identified until last April. Earlier this summer, a friend from Montreal called the LAPD. She remembered seeing Jurvetson with a man named Jean—and a second man named Jean—at a coffee shop. She helped police develop a sketch of the Jeans, who may have been roommates, and now detectives are looking for the pair. One LAPD investigator calls Jean \"the best lead we have.\" Police also got another lead recently when they discovered where Jurvetson had been living in Hollywood before her death, CBC reports.

       " '– The world\\'s oldest known flower dating back 130 million years is an aquatic species called Montsechia found fossilized in limestone deposits in Spain. But it wouldn\\'t necessarily be recognized as a flower today, given it didn\\'t boast petals or nectar-producing structures. \"The fruit contains a single seed\"—thus making it an angiosperm, or flowering plant—\"which is borne upside down,\" says Indiana University paleobotanist David Dilcher, who with colleagues reports these findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The plant thrived in freshwater lakes in what are now Spain\\'s mountainous regions, and while Phys.org reports that the fossils were first discovered more than 100 years ago, the ones used in this study were \"poorly understood and even misinterpreted\" when analyzed at earlier points, Dilcher says. One way to spread seed—which in angiosperms is typically done by getting other animals (think bees) or elements (think wind) to carry pollen to other members of the same species—is through water currents. In fact today\\'s descendants of Montsechia, called Ceratophyllum, are found in lakes on every continent, and they behave similarly. \"Flowers are all about sex,” Dilcher tells Newsweek. \"Right at the start [of angiosperm evolution], this was another method that flowering plants were using for their genetic exchange.\" Whether Montsechia is the world\\'s oldest flower has yet to be determined, but it is the oldest flower we have found to date, suggesting that angiosperms have their earliest roots in water instead of on land.

The boy made it through the five-hour flight unharmed yesterday despite freezing temperatures at 38,000 feet and a lack of oxygen, the AP reports. An FBI spokesman says the boy was apparently unconscious for most of the flight and he was taken into custody after being found wandering around the grounds of the airport in a disoriented state.

North Korea\\'s KCNA news agency quoted Kim Jong Un as saying \"American bastards would be not very happy with this gift sent on the July 4 anniversary,\" the Guardian reports. The agency said Kim, who has vowed not to give up the country\\'s nuclear program, urged his nuclear scientists to \"frequently send big and small \\'gift packages\\' to the Yankees.\" According to KCNA, the missile North Korea launched Tuesday is capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead. The latest: The US and South Korea responded to the launch with a joint ballistic missile exercise in the Sea of Japan on Tuesday, reports the BBC. The two countries warned that \"self-restraint\" was \"all that separated armistice and war.\" The US vowed to take tougher measures on North Korea, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson calling for global action, reports Reuters. \"All nations should publicly demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to their pursuit of nuclear weapons,\" he said. The United Nations Security Council will hold a meeting on the issue Wednesday. The New York Times looks at the different options President Trump can proceed with, and finds that they are \"few and risky.\" One option that China and Russia agree on involves Pyongyang suspending its nuclear weapons program in return for the US suspending joint military exercises with South Korea. The launch of an ICBM has long been seen as a \"red line,\" though analysts believe Pyongyang may still be years away from having long-range nuclear capability, the AP reports. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of the British Armed Forces Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Regiment, says \"in capability of missile terms and delivery, it is a major step up and they seem to be making progress week-on-week,\" but \"actually marrying the warhead to the missile is probably the biggest challenge, which they appear not to have progressed on.\" The Los Angeles Times reports that the ICBM launch wasn\\'t a huge surprise for some analysts, who observed that North Korea had two mysterious launch failures at the same facility last fall. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation looks at just how far the North Korean ICBM could go. Experts believe Alaska and possibly some America\\'s Pacific bases are now in range, as is northern Australia.\\n',\n",

When 26-year-old Yankees fan Andrew Rector fell asleep during a game against the Red Sox on April 13, an ESPN cameraman lingered on his snoozing face and two announcers launched into a diatribe that included the words \"stupor, stupid, fatty, and unintelligent\"—that according to a $10 million lawsuit Rector filed last Thursday against the Yankees, Major League Baseball, ESPN, and the two announcers, John Kruk and Dan Shulman, claiming defamation and \"intentional infliction of emotional distress,\" reports Courthouse News Service. The New York Times points out that Shulman and Kruk said no such words in the clip (Shulman did, however, call him \"oblivious\"), though it\\'s unclear whether they commented on the 4th-inning nap later. Rector\\'s complaint is filled with misspellings and odd turns of phrases (Courthouse News calls the writing style \"idiosyncratic\"). An example, from paragraph 14, published on The Smoking Gun: \"John Kruck [sic] in his verbal attack insinuated that the plaintiff is an individual that know neither history nor understood the beauty or rivalry between Boston Red Sox and New York Yankee.\" In his suit, Rector argues that the defendants presented false facts about him, including, \"Plaintiff is not worthy to be fan of the New York Yankee,\" and, more colorfully, \"Plaintiff is a fatty cow that need two seats at all time and represent symbol of failure.\" Rector\\'s mother tells the Times the aftermath has been so bad he\\'s had to miss work.

       " '– Around 1995, Linda and Robert Tofolowsky noticed the walls of the basement in their Connecticut home cracking. Their foundation had developed severe fissures, and they soon discovered other homes in the area with the same issue. Their insurance claim was denied, they got no help from the town or the state, and they lost their lawsuit against JJ Mottes, the company that installed the concrete for the foundation. In a 2001 complaint the couple filed with the Consumer Protection Department, Linda wrote that the issue needed to be made public \"so that maybe someone else will not lose their biggest investment, their home.\" The couple ended up being just the first of hundreds of homeowners in the state whose foundations are crumbling, causing their houses to slowly collapse. \"When you’re told your home is now worthless and your biggest investment is now worthless, it’s devastating,\" one such homeowner tells the New York Times. As the Times points out, state officials were warned about the problem by more than just the Tofolowskys in the early 2000s, and in 2003, lawmakers met with the CPD, representatives from the attorney general\\'s office, and homeowners about the issue—but did nothing. In July 2015, WVIT did an investigative report on the foundations, prompting state officials to open an inquiry. They recently announced that the problem is at least partially caused by high levels of pyrrhotite (a mineral that can cause swelling and cracking when mixed with water) from aggregate in a local quarry used in JJ Mottes\\' concrete, the Hartford Courant reported last month; a spokesperson for JJ Mottes blames contractors who improperly added water to wet concrete so it would pour faster. Officials are taking steps to help homeowners, but none of those steps do much to subsidize their costs, and WVIT notes that insurance companies are only settling with some homeowners and only after \"long legal battles.\"\\n',\n",

The sport suspended Kurt Busch indefinitely yesterday over allegations that he beat and choked his then-girlfriend last fall, reports ESPN.

The judge cited Busch\\'s \"propensity to lose control of his behavior and act out violently in response to stressful, disappointing and/or frustrating situations involving his racing,\" reports the News Journal.

       " '– A veteran pilot\\'s theory about what happened to Flight 370 dazzled the Internet yesterday, but aviation writer Jeff Wise is poking holes in it today at Slate. If you missed it, pilot Chris Goodfellow speculated at Google Plus that a fire aboard the missing Malaysian jet caused its disappearance. The pilots went off course deliberately to reach the nearest airport—on the island of Langkawi—but the smoke got to them before they could land, and the plane kept flying on its own over the ocean until it crashed. A world desperate for answers soaked it up, but Wise says the theory doesn\\'t hold up when other facts about Flight 370 are considered. Specifically: \"While it’s true that MH370 did turn toward Langkawi and wound up overflying it, whoever was at the controls continued to maneuver after that point as well,\" writes Wise. One subsequent waypoint picked up a sharp right turn and another a left turn. \"Such vigorous navigating would have been impossible for unconscious men.\" A final electronic ping picked up from the plane put it on one of two paths, one over central Asia as far as Kazakhstan and the other out over the Indian Ocean. \"As MH370 flew from its original course toward Langkawi, it was headed toward neither,\" writes Wise. \"Without human intervention—which would go against Goodfellow’s theory—it simply could not have reached the position we know it attained\" at 8:11am on March 8, the time of that last ping. The bottom line is that \"Goodfellow\\'s theory falls apart,\" writes Wise. Click for his full column.

Four Pinocchios, which happens to be the max. Though he might have been forgiven for such a grand proclamation while the bill was still being drafted, the president continued to make the claim even once the law had been signed and its potential impact on insurance plans was clear, writes Glenn Kessler. Further, the law\\'s design purposefully quashes \"substandard\" plans that the Americans on them certainly might like, in no small part because they can be cheap. So Kessler amends the president\\'s infamous line: \"If you like your health care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health care plan—if we deem it to be adequate.\" Other pundits are also weighing in: What Obama \"meant was you can keep it if he likes it,\" echoes Holman Jenkins in the Wall Street Journal. The bottom line, for Jenkins: \"He wants you to pay for coverage you\\'ll never use (mental-health services, cancer wigs, fertility treatments, Viagra) so the money can be spent on somebody else.\" \"The GOP outrage about Americans supposedly \\'losing\\' coverage is largely just more of the same old misdirection,\" writes Greg Sargent in the Washington Post. \"It’s a subset of a larger Republican refusal to have an actual debate about the law’s tradeoffs—one in which the law’s benefits for millions of Americans are also reckoned with in a serious way.\" Jonah Goldberg says Obama\\'s statement \"looks like the biggest lie about domestic policy ever uttered by a US president.\" The question, writes Goldberg at National Review Online, is whether \"he was simply \\'playing to win\\' and therefore lying on purpose\" or whether he actually believed his own spin. \"The president\\'s message about his signature law has always been: It gets better, I promise,\" writes John Dickerson at Slate. \"That was always an uphill battle.

Megan Huntsman was a heavy methamphetamine user when she strangled or suffocated the newborns between 1996 and 2006, a police spokesman tells the AP. He says she wasn\\'t concerned about potential health problems caused to the infants by her drug use—but did care about the cost of feeding her addiction. \"It was completely selfish. She was high on drugs and didn\\'t want the babies, or the responsibility,\" he says. \"That was her priority at the time.\" \"She had to make a decision between the drugs and the babies,\" says the police spokesman, who confirmed that the five girls and two boys found in boxes in her garage were all fathered by her husband, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Investigators believe one of the babies was stillborn, so Huntsman faces six counts of first-degree felony murder. She has been in jail since April with bail set at $6 million. Her long-estranged husband, who spent eight years in federal prison on meth charges, was the one who alerted police after finding one of the dead infants and is not considered a suspect.\\n',\n",

Now there\\'s a new and improved version of the clock—and it\\'s \"the most accurate clock of its kind in the world,\" the institute says. NIST-F2 boasts three times the accuracy of F1. \"If you could run either of these clocks for 100 million years, NIST-F1 would lose one second; NIST-F2 would lose 1/3 of a second,\" says F2\\'s lead designer. One second is defined worldwide in terms of oscillations of a cesium atom (9,192,631,770 of those oscillations, to be precise). Both clocks determine the time by tossing 10 million such atoms into the air and using lasers to analyze them, the Los Angeles Times explains. What\\'s better about the new clock is that it uses chilled conditions to fight background radiation, thus improving its assessment. Why be so careful? Everything from cell phones to GPS use atomic clock measurements, researchers say, per PC Magazine. \"If we\\'ve learned anything in the last 60 years of building atomic clocks, we\\'ve learned that every time we build a better clock, somebody comes up with a use for it that you couldn\\'t have foreseen,\" says the designer.\\n',\n",

The federal government says it\\'s reviewing Brown\\'s visa application after the singer announced a December tour in the country and Australian Minister for Women Michaelia Cash says they aren\\'t \"afraid to say no.\" After all, Australia in February barred boxer Floyd Mayweather, who served time in jail for an assault on a former partner in 2012, reports the Guardian. \"People need to understand, if you are going to commit domestic violence and you want to travel around the world, there are going to be countries that say to you, \\'You cannot come in because you are not of the character that we expect in Australia,\\'\" says Cash, who spoke just as new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced a $100 million national domestic violence prevention program.

Bonus: This strain of Shigella is resistant to the go-to antibiotic in such cases, ciprofloxacin, or Cipro. A CDC report says the agency has tracked 243 cases in 32 states between May of last year and February of this year. Massachusetts, California, and Pennsylvania have seen the worst of it, and 20% of patients had to be hospitalized. The CDC thinks the illness was brought back to the US from travelers to India, the Dominican Republic, Morocco, and elsewhere, reports NPR. But the disease is so contagious that it\\'s quickly spreading beyond those initial contacts. \"If rates of resistance become this high, in more places, we\\'ll have very few options left for treating shigella with antibiotics by mouth,\" says lead researcher Anna Bowen.

In most cases, it goes away on its own after about a week. In its report, the CDC advises those traveling abroad to be extra vigilant about washing their hands, watching what they eat, and using over-the-counter treatments such as Pepto-Bismol before grabbing Cipro.\\n',\n",

Unfortunately, numerous studies suggest that the levels of blue light in the high-intensity LED bulbs could have health ramifications, including sleep problems and even increased risk for cancer and heart disease. The evidence is apparently strong enough to prompt the American Medical Association to issue a warning in June that LED street lights can impair and even damage nighttime vision, reports Tech Times. Problem is, almost 13% of roadway lighting now uses LEDs, with many places planning a switch, reports the Washington Post. Seattle has been downright dismissive of any health concerns, while New York has gone so far as to switch to lower-intensity LED bulbs the AMA considers safe when residents complain. Lake Worth, Fla., meanwhile, has plans to replace its sodium street lights with more than 4,000 LED lights that have less of the potentially harmful blue light and more of an amber hue, while Gloucester, Mass., has consulted its own residents and decided to play it safe and go with less blue in their LEDs, which they\\'ll finish installing next month.

A study on last year\\'s finalists turned up something interesting, reports Teen Vogue: 83% of the 40 were children of immigrants. And as NPR reports, new research may suggest a possible contributing factor. Reporting in the journal Demography, the two researchers looked at US census data and found that immigrants tend to choose jobs requiring physical strength, suggesting obstacles to accessing to higher levels of education. But among immigrants with a college degree, the landscape is very different. Those who went to college, came to the States as older children, and hailed from a country more linguistically different than the US (think Vietnam vs. Germany) were much more likely to pursue a science, tech, engineering, or math (STEM) field. This is especially true for kids arriving after age 10. The researchers hypothesize in a press release that such immigrants may prefer working on a subject like math, a universal language. \"The more difficult it is for the child to learn English [and it becomes trickier after 10], the more likely they will invest in math/logic and physical skills over communications skills,\" says co-author Marcos Rangel. It\\'s not a full explanation, but they hope to highlight that there may be many nuances influencing why we pursue the fields we do. (Here\\'s what migrant children are fleeing.)\\n',\n",

Residents of the South Miami neighborhood where the incident took place say they\\'ve actually named the three large crocodiles that live behind their homes—Pancho, Snaggletooth, and Streetwalker—and wildlife officials assume one of those three is to blame, the Guardian reports. Jimenez is still in the hospital recovering from bites on his torso and hands; Rendon is home recovering from a shoulder bite. One wildlife official says the couple struggled with the 9-foot crocodile and eventually made their way to shore, where other partygoers who heard the noise pulled them out of the water. Officials aren\\'t calling it an attack, though, because \"crocodiles are most active at dawn and dusk, they’re looking for food, and this one would have interpreted what was in the water as food,\" he said. \"It’s common sense never to swim where you know there are crocodiles and alligators.\" Crocodiles typically avoid contact with humans, Reuters notes.

The Canadian prime minister says the vice president told him there would have to be a \"sunset clause\" guaranteeing that the deal would expire in five years, the Washington Post reports. Trudeau says this would create far too much uncertainty for businesses. He says the visit was called off after he made it clear to Pence that no Canadian leader would sign a deal containing a sunset clause. Trump said in a statement Thursday that the US \"has been taken advantage of for many decades on trade\" and the message was conveyed to Trudeau that Washington will \"agree to a fair deal, or there will be no deal at all.\" \"FAIR TRADE!\" he tweeted. Trudeau denounced new US tariffs on Canadian, Mexican, and EU imports as \"totally unacceptable\" and said Ottawa will slap tariffs on $12.8 billion worth of US goods, the AP reports. Trump previously framed our dependence on imported metals as a national security threat, and Trudeau addressed that: \"Canada is a secure supplier of aluminum and steel to the US defense industry, putting aluminum in American planes and steel in American tanks.

Normally, if an ultrasound and blood test show a woman\\'s risk of an affected pregnancy is high, doctors can perform additional tests to identify possible Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome, or Patau syndrome using a needle that collects fluid or tissue from a woman\\'s womb. These procedures—either an amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling—aren\\'t fun, nor are the weeks of worry that can precede them. But researcher Nicholas Wald says new \"reflex DNA screening\" led to a 100-fold reduction in false positives at five UK maternity wards and prevented \"nearly all invasive diagnostic tests in unaffected pregnancies,\" per a release. In this method, described in Genetics in Medicine, doctors take a blood sample from a woman around 11 weeks of pregnancy and split it into two. If the first sample shows a woman\\'s risk for an affected pregnancy is 1 in 800 or higher, doctors use the second sample to search for DNA from the placenta that would indicate a disorder, reports the Guardian. Over a 16-month study period involving 23,000 women, the test detected 95% of affected pregnancies, compared to 81% with the previous method. The rate of false positives, meanwhile, fell to 0.02% from 2.4%. In the end, only one of 26 women who underwent the diagnostic test had an unaffected pregnancy, adds Wald, who notes \"the extra costs of the DNA tests are offset against savings from fewer amniocenteses and associated counseling.\"\\n',\n",

He\\'ll also be fined $2.5 million, which Silver said was the maximum allowed under the NBA constitution. In addition, Silver said he\\'ll move to force the sale of the Clippers. Silver said the NBA had investigated the incident and interviewed Sterling, and concluded that Sterling was the man on infamous taped conversations, \"and that the hateful opinions voiced by that man are those of Mr. Sterling.\" He said he would encourage the other owners to force Sterling to sell the team, which can be done with a three-quarters vote. \"This has been a painful moment for all members of the NBA family,\" he said, adding that he felt \"personal outrage\" over the comments. In addition: Asked if an owner should be pushed out for comments made in private, Silver replied, \"Whether or not these remarks were initially shared in private, they are now public, and they represent his views.\" Silver said he hadn\\'t formally polled the owners, but that he\\'d spoken to several and \"I have their full support.\" He said he was confident they would agree to oust Sterling. Asked if the league was seeking more African-American ownership, Silver said the league was diverse, but \"I\\'d always like to see it become more diverse.\" Asked about Magic Johnson specifically, he said Johnson knows that \"he is always welcome as an owner in this league ... and a close friend of the NBA family.\" Johnson tweeted out his approval of Silver\\'s move. \"In Commissioner Adam Silver we have a great leader leading our league,\" he said, adding, \"The people who I\\'m happiest for are Coach Doc Rivers, the Clippers players, and fans.\" Silver had singled out Rivers and Chris Paul to thank them for their leadership.\\n',\n",

But while Canadian guidelines define death as the irreversible end of brain function and breathing ability, Ouanounou\\'s Orthodox Jewish family is fighting to keep Ouanounou on life support based on their religion\\'s assertion that death occurs only when the heart stops beating.

Police say Scout Schultz, who identified as non-binary instead of male or female, was shot after they responded to a 911 call about a person armed with a knife and gun outside a dormitory, WSB reports. Schultz doesn\\'t appear to have had a gun, but police say the student was shot after refusing orders to drop a knife. Graphic video of the incident shows the 21-year-old walking toward officers and shouting \"Shoot me!\" around a minute before being shot by one of four nearby officers, reports the Washington Post. Video shows that Schultz\\'s hands were down when the student approached officers, and photos from the scene show a utility tool that apparently included a blade, though it wasn\\'t extended. A lawyer for Schultz\\'s family accuses officers of overreacting. It appears Schultz \"was having a mental breakdown and didn\\'t know what to do,\" the lawyer says. \"The area was secured. There was no one around at risk.\" Schultz\\'s mother tells the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that her eldest child, who was born Scott, suffered from depression and attempted suicide two years ago. \"Why didn\\'t they use some nonlethal force, like pepper spray or Tasers?\" she wonders.\\n',\n",

Writer Drew Grant took issue with the fact that Franco addressed New Orleans ghost tours in his column, rather than something more substantive like politics. Franco responded in yesterday’s column, where he first slammed the Observer for being “a newspaper owned by Donald Trump's son-in-law that is perhaps best known for publishing a sex column in the mid-1990s.” He goes on to explain that he didn’t discuss politics—specifically President Obama’s stance on gay marriage—because there’s “enough talk about that already,” and “plus, who wants to hear an actor’s take on it anyway?” He chose his topic because it seemed interesting, he concludes, and the real question is why “the great journalists at the New York Observer” are, “instead of covering pressing world issues, … covering my writing, which they claim to consider petty.” Click for his full column, which somehow segues into the topic of commencement speeches.\\n\",\n",

As the AP explains, the plan is built around the brown tree snakes\\' two main weaknesses: They\\'ll chow down on prey they didn\\'t kill themselves and are highly vulnerable to the painkiller (it\\'s the active ingredient in Tylenol). And by attaching the mice to parachutes, which will be dropped by hand one at a time, researchers say they\\'ll lodge in trees, away from other animals. The mice drop has been attempted before, but a Department of Agriculture official says that now, \"We are taking this to a new phase. There really is no other place in the world with a snake problem like Guam.\" That\\'s because the snakes, which invaded the island during World War II via military ships in the South Pacific, have killed off most of the island\\'s native bird species, are dinging tourism, and could do serious financial harm should they make their way to Hawaii.

Because a familiar pattern on church matters is repeating itself, writes CS Pearce in the Los Angeles Times.

Over time, however, most Christians reject the literal interpretation for one more in keeping with the Bible\\'s \"core values of compassion, justice and peace.\" Pearce says most scholars agree that only three New Testament passages address homosexuality, though not \"as we define it today but rather with temple prostitution and other abuses.\" And yes, the Old Testament says it merits execution, but the same applies to unruly sons and those who work on Sundays. \"It will only be a matter of time before the majority of Christians of all stripes become allies rather than antagonists for justice and equal rights for gay people,\" writes Pearce. \"Then we will come out on the right side of history once again.\" Read the full column here.

Each spring, the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy draws about 40,000 spectators to a tiny island perched between Ireland and Great Britain, in the Irish sea. They come to watch racers careen around a 37.7-mile circuit with more than 400 turns, at speeds of up to 200 mph, in an event sometimes called the “Isle of Manslaughter.\" More than 140 racers have been killed in the 111-year history of the event, according to Fox.

The Ohio man was rushed to the hospital on Aug. 5 after his wife realized he was breathing oddly in his sleep and found herself unable to wake him. Since his arteries were clear, doctors were optimistic—until his heart stopped beating. They spent 45 minutes trying to revive the 37-year-old before declaring him dead.

A Marine Corps investigation used facial recognition technology and other photos taken that day to conclude, with \"near certainty,\" that one of the six men IDed in the famous image taken by photographer Joe Rosenthal was not a Navy corpsman by the name of John Bradley, but Pvt. 1st Class Harold Schultz, a Marine who died in 1995, USA Today reports. As for Bradley, it appears he\\'s not in the photo at all, but Charles Neimeyer, a Marine Corps historian who was on the panel that scrutinized the image, says Bradley may have legitimately thought he was in the photo: There had been two US flag-raisings on Feb. 23, 1945, and Rosenthal\\'s picture captures the second one. Bradley may have been involved with the first; the gear he was wearing that day doesn\\'t sync with what is captured in the photo. Although Schultz, who received a Purple Heart for his war efforts, never publicly acknowledged any possible role, his stepdaughter tells the New York Times that one fleeting dinner conversation about Iwo Jima in the early 1990s led her to believe he was in the photo. \"My mom was distracted and not listening and Harold said, \\'I was one of the flag raisers,\\'\" Dezreen MacDowell says. \"I said, \\'My gosh, Harold, you\\'re a hero.\\' He said, \\'No, I was a Marine.\\'\" She said he never brought it up again, being a \"self-effacing Midwestern person.\" Schultz\\'s name will be swapped in for Bradley\\'s in any references to the photo.

A new study notes hippopotamuses, already predicted by some to disappear within 100 years, may be dying at unexpected rates to fuel the trade of ivory ornaments made from hippo teeth. Since 1975, 1.7 million pounds of hippo teeth have been traded around the world, with 90% of that trade passing through Hong Kong, according to researchers at the University of Hong Kong. Of that 90%, 75% has come from Uganda and Tanzania. Like Hong Kong, both African countries report their legal trade volumes to CITES, an organization that monitors trade in threatened species. What irks researchers, however, is that the reported volumes don\\'t add up. CITES data shows Hong Kong has actually received more hippo teeth from Tanzania since 1980 than Tanzania claims it exported, and less hippo teeth from Uganda since 1991 than Uganda claims it sent, notes the study in the African Journal of Ecology. The result is 30,860 pounds of hippo teeth—the equivalent from 2,700 hippos, or 2% of the animal\\'s global population—overlooked, reports Quartz. \"If authorities do not more diligently monitor the international trade in threatened species, those species could be exposed to unmanageable exploitation levels, which could lead to extinction,\" says study author Alexandra Andersson in a release. \"The fate of hippos—and a plethora of other species—could depend on it.\" (People are also getting ivory from … woolly mammoths.)\\n',\n",

The clip shows two OHP troopers shouting at the assistant pastor and his brother, Brandon Fischer. The two had been fishing on their dad\\'s property in rural Okmulgee County when their truck stalled on a flooded road; the troopers showed up at around 9:30pm to find the men apparently standing in rising floodwaters trying to push the truck. \"Come on! Get out of that water! Boys, state troopers!\" trooper Mark Southall shouts in the video. \"Settle down, you understand me? Settle down.\" The brothers can be seen entering the video; Nehemiah rushes Southall and the two move off-camera; the other trooper is filmed drawing his gun, then the clip ends.

Or at least it\\'s not as bad as we previously thought, per a sweeping new study that suggests low-fat diets could increase the risk of early death, the Telegraph reports. The surprising findings published in the Lancet suggest that instead of limiting fat intake, we should be counting carbs. Low-fat diets \"put populations at increased risk for cardiovascular disease,\" says Dr. Andrew Mente from Canada\\'s McMaster University. Overturning dietary guidelines the world over, the research of Mente and his team indicates that a higher consumption of fats, even saturated fats like those found in meat and butter, reduces chances of dying earlier. The scientists who tracked 135,000 adults in 18 countries found that those who got more than 60% of their calories from carbohydrates, such as sugary drinks and processed foods like pasta and bread, had a 28% chance of dying early. Those who consumed high levels of fats, even the saturated kind, saw their risk of early death drop by 23%. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the seven-year study found no link between fat consumption alone and heart disease or stroke, CBC News reports. But in a notable limitation, researchers were unable to measure levels of trans fat, often linked to heart disease, in study subjects. Study co-author Dr. Mahshid Dehghan says that when lowering fat consumption, people \"by default\" eat more carbs. He called for \"relaxing current restrictions on fat and emphasizing ... carbohydrate intake.\" The \"sweet spot,\" Mente adds, per the Telegraph, is maintaining a balanced diet, with about 35% of calories coming from fat.

Researchers say this new process could allow organs to be grown on demand, ending organ shortages. But they warn that\\'s far in the future. In the meantime, it could be used to research diseases and test drugs in animals. But there are still moral questions surrounding the creation of animal-human chimeras, with some scientists expressing concern about making animals with human brains or reproductive organs.

According to the commander of the special forces all the staff who were inside the building have been rescued,\" an injured anchorman told viewers, per the Guardian. Authorities say two grenade-throwing attackers, including a suicide bomber, killed two security guards in the raid on the Shamshad TV building, the BBC reports. Around 20 people were injured. \"This is an attack on freedom of media but they cannot silence us,\" Shamshad TV\\'s news director said while visiting wounded colleagues. \"I was in my office when gunmen wearing police uniforms attacked the building,\" he said. \"They killed one of our guards and entered the building and started firing. Most of us were able to flee but some were wounded and some jumped out of the window.\" The AP reports that the Taliban denied responsibility, while an ISIS-linked news outlet said that group was behind the attack.\\n',\n",
       " '– A new study out of the University of Texas\\' Center for BrainHealth and the Mind Research Network is showing brain differences in regular pot users—differences that have already been reported in lab mice. The study, published in PNAS, found that 48 \"chronic\" users who smoked at least four times a week had less gray matter in the orbitofrontal cortex than 62 control subjects who didn\\'t use pot, reports the Los Angeles Times. The orbitofrontal cortex \"helps us determine what is good for us and what keeps us sustained,\" the lead author tells the Washington Post. It\\'s unclear whether these \"shrunken brains\" are the result of chronic use or contribute to the tendency to use in the first place. Researchers also found that the orbitofrontal cortex is better connected in chronic users, with a faster signal flow throughout the motivation- and decision-making network and even across the white matter connecting the brain\\'s left and right hemispheres. One possible explanation? That increased \"connectedness\" might be compensating for the not-up-to-snuff gray matter. That finding was more pronounced for users who started smoking pot young, \"which may explain why chronic, long-term users \\'seem to be doing just fine\\' despite smaller OFC brain volumes,\" according to a release. An earlier study from 2012 found that 12-year-olds with smaller orbitofrontal cortices were more likely to start using pot by age 16, indicating a possible predisposition to marijuana use in those with deficits in this part of the brain. (Marijuana use has also been linked to heart problems.)\\n',\n",

Those loans may be predatory, and customers who fail to pay will get sued in Virginia courtrooms no matter where they live, Pacific Standard reports. An added wrinkle: Many of the customers are in the US military. \"They’re basically ruthless,\" an Army staff sergeant said after he bought items at a Georgia outlet and was sued in Virginia while serving in Germany. Yet the company still attracts service members by offering them credit counseling in stores near military bases. And \"after the horse is out of the barn, there’s not a lot you can do about it,\" says a finance expert. Take Army Private Jeramie Mays: He bought a $650 laptop for $2,993 (including add-ons and interest over 23 months) at a USA Discounters in Texas, then failed to pay and eventually filed for bankruptcy. His story isn\\'t so unusual, either: USA Discounters has won 89% of its 13,470 Virginia lawsuits since 2006, court records say, and seizes more pay from military service members than any other US company, ProPublica reports.

       " '– Aaron Sorkin makes his directorial debut in Molly\\'s Game, derived from Molly Bloom\\'s tell-all book of the same name. It chronicles the real-life events surrounding Bloom\\'s weekly high-stakes poker game frequented by celebrities before it was busted by the FBI. Critics give the film starring Jessica Chastain an 82% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Here\\'s what they\\'re saying: \"This is a \\'Game\\' that couldn\\'t be more fun to watch,\" writes Calvin Wilson at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"Sorkin crafts a fast-moving tale of risky business, crammed with the kind of snappy dialogue for which he\\'s famous\" in a \"stylish and absorbing\" debut. \"But the film wouldn\\'t work quite as well without Chastain,\" who \"gets deep inside Molly\\'s skin,\" he writes. It\\'s \"an Oscar-worthy performance.\" \"Despite Ms. Chastain\\'s charisma and gift for delivering Mr. Sorkin\\'s fast talk, Molly isn\\'t interesting,\" writes Manohla Dargis at the New York Times, detecting a \"patronizing\" air in the way the protagonist receives \"so much male defending.\" \"By attempting to portray Molly as any kind of female victim—and by glossing over her culpability—Mr. Sorkin only ends up denying this character her agency,\" Dargis writes. Michael Phillips, however, thinks Molly\\'s Game is \"a good, brash biopic\" and \"very nearly terrific\" through the first hour. Moving between the past and present, it sees Chastain nail the role of Bloom, while Idris Elba is \"a godsend\" as her attorney with \"a lively wit and fire in the eyes,\" Phillips writes at the Chicago Tribune. He argues the film falters in the second half when \"the writing gets blunt and a little less artful.\" Bob Mondello was impressed throughout. Thanks to a \"whip-smart\" cast, the \"Sorkinian back-and-forth dialogue is exhilarating\" and helps make \"the finer points of poker—and legal maneuvering—crystal clear,\" a necessity in such a \"dense, complicated movie,\" he writes at NPR. The visuals, \"precisely shot and edited with nearly every trick known to contemporary filmmaking,\" are just as good, he adds.\\n',\n",

Originally he had planned to drop troop levels from 9,800 to 5,500 by the end of 2016. The numbers reflect a compromise between Obama\\'s original plan and what many military commanders had recommended given a Taliban resurgence, reports the AP. Obama says the security situation in Afghanistan remains precarious and that Afghan security forces are not as strong as they need to be. Last month a group of more than a dozen former US ambassadors and former commanders of US forces in Afghanistan wrote to Obama urging that he sustain the current level of troops through the remainder of his term in office, per the AP. \"Unless emergency conditions require consideration of a modest increase, we would strongly favor a freeze at the level of roughly 10,000 US troops through January 30,\" they wrote in a June 1 letter. \"This approach would allow your successor to assess for herself or himself and make further adjustments accordingly.\"\\n',\n",

Lawyers for James Fields suggested as much Monday as jury selection got underway in the closely watched murder trial in Virginia, reports C-ville. For one thing, attorney John Hill asked potential jurors their views on whether violence could be justified in cases of self-defense, reports the Daily Progress, which notes that University of North Carolina professor Dwayne Dixon is on the witness list. Dixon is affiliated with the Antifa movement, and he has publicly talked about seeing Fields on the block he was patrolling shortly before the crash. In a speech at Harvard, Dixon said Fields \"paused right in front of me, and I waved him off with my rifle,\" per IndyWeek. Far-right conspiracy theorists have used Dixon\\'s comments to make the case that Fields was fleeing when he drove into the crowd, per the Daily Progress. Prosecutors plans to show jurors video showing that Fields backed up, then accelerated into the counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Also on the witness list: an officer, one who normally worked as a school resource officer, who left her position before the crash because she feared for her personal safety. The trial is expected to last three weeks, though jury selection could take days.\\n',\n",

The boys participated in a training camp for sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-graders, Sporting News reports, and were \"so impressive\" they were promoted to play against eighth-graders. \"It\\'s tough to know whether tracking 11-year-olds is the beginning of the end of civilization as we know it or whether we\\'ll all be remembering this golden moment when the two are playing in Super Bowl 70,\" Cindy Boren writes for the Washington Post. AL.com notes some of the reasons there\\'s been pushback, such as dangers to players whose peers suddenly grow much bigger, a kid not being able to live up to expectations when he\\'s branded a wunderkind too early, and the difficulty of predicting how a youngster will evolve as a player. Bryden\\'s dad doesn\\'t have an issue with it, though, telling Bleacher Report \"that is exactly why they call them prospects. … Rivals is merely identifying potential future talent.

In its report, the Washington Post notes that while the 20-year sentence she is due to serve \"brought an end to Patel’s trial ... it may be only the beginning of the public debate about the details of her case.\" The case began in July 2013, when Patel went to St. Joseph Hospital in Mishawaka, Indiana, bleeding and with a protruding umbilical cord, a doctor testified. Patel later revealed that she had a miscarriage and had left the fetus, which she says was stillborn, in a dumpster. Prosecutors argued the baby was born alive, hence the child neglect charge. The feticide charge (which PRI frames as \"normally used against those who harm pregnant women\") was based on text messages Patel sent indicating she had taken drugs purchased from China in an attempt to abort her fetus, reports the AP; tests showed no such drugs in her or the fetus, however. She was in February found guilty on both counts, though many have argued the two charges were \"legally contradictory.\" PRI reports that the gestational age of the fetus was fiercely debated at the trial. Her defense argued it was at most 24 weeks old, and would not have survived even with medical intervention; NBC News reports prosecutors argued she was 25 weeks along in their opening statement, and the aforementioned doctor testified that he thought the fetus was as many as 30 weeks. Patel indicated she would appeal. (In Indiana, a man was charged with attempted feticide after police say he spiked a woman\\'s drink with special herbs.)\\n',\n",

The 67-year-old, the oldest prisoner on the state\\'s death row, was executed hours after the Supreme Court rejected an appeal, ABC News reports. Prosecutors said that in 1983, Bower shot contractor Bob Tate to steal an ultralight aircraft, then killed three other men who unexpectedly arrived at the hangar, reports Reuters. But Bower always maintained his innocence, and his execution was stayed six times, most recently in February. \"Much has been written about this case, not all of it has been the truth,\" he said in his final statement. \"But the time is over and now it is time to move on.\" He was pronounced dead at 6:36pm yesterday. When Bower was arrested, he was working as a chemical salesman, had no criminal record, and was married with two daughters. In his appeals, his lawyers argued that there was no hard evidence connecting him to the crime and the killings had actually occurred after a drug deal gone wrong, the Guardian reports. His lawyers also argued that the long time Bower spent on death row constituted cruel and unusual punishment, but state officials countered that his claims were a \"meritless attempt to postpone his execution\" and the length of time on death row was \"purely of his own making\" because he had spent so long fighting his conviction in the courts, reports the Washington Post.

A months-long investigation by Microsoft found the ZeroAccess botnet infecting some 2 million computers with malware that generated bogus clicks on ads, netting criminals $2.7 million a month from online advertisers. Microsoft cut connections between infected machines in the US and European-based servers, while Europol seized servers tied to 18 IP addresses in Latvia, Germany, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, the Wall Street Journal reports. \"These aren\\'t just kids operating in their parent\\'s basement,\" explains an advertising technology exec. \"What we have here are organized crime groups in foreign countries targeting the ad world.\" Microsoft\\'s Digital Crimes Unit spent months studying ZeroAccess in a Redmond, Washington, lab, learning that the botnet isn\\'t controlled by a dedicated server, but can respond to commands issued by any infected computer. But even after Microsoft\\'s move, which included filing a civil suit against eight \"John Doe\" defendants, ZeroAccess isn\\'t necessarily dead for good, notes PC World. Investigators didn\\'t expect to stop the botnet completely, and a previous attack by Symantec only disrupted the operation. \"If we can\\'t put the bad guys in jail,\" says a Microsoft investigator, \"at least we can take away some of their money.\"\\n',\n",

The man served 16 days for simple battery—but she ended up in jail herself for three days. A now-viral video has surfaced well after it was shot in a Seminole County courtroom; it shows Judge Jerri Collins showing the victim \"no pity,\" as WFTV puts it, for failing to appear in court for her alleged abuser\\'s trial. ABC News references court documents that say the woman was served with a subpoena in June, but was a no-show on July 22; on July 30 she was made to attend a contempt of court hearing. Crying, she apologized for not appearing, said she\\'s been battling depression and anxiety, and said she had earlier asked that the charges against the man be dropped. Collins found her in contempt of court and ordered her to jail. \"You disobeyed a court order, knowing that this was not going to turn out well for the state,\" said Collins. WFTV also quotes Collins as saying, \"You think you\\'re going to have anxiety now? You haven\\'t even seen anxiety.\" The wailing woman begs Collins to change her mind, saying she has to care for her son. She had previously explained that her child\\'s father had been jailed once before, causing him to lose his job and miss child support payments; she had to \"sell everything I own\" and, homeless, move in with her parents. The State Attorney\\'s Office issued a statement saying the woman had told the office \"she didn\\'t care if she was arrested as a result of her not complying with the court\\'s subpoena.\" The CEO of SafeHouse, which houses abuse victims, is gobsmacked. \"There\\'s no—absolutely nothing that I could think of that would be the reason to re-victimize this person by putting her in jail.\" (In another case, a mother received a longer jail term than the man who raped her son.)\\n',\n",

Law enforcement sources tell TMZ no one from the rehab facility called the county coroner—and now both the coroner and the LA County Sheriff\\'s Department are suspicious and are investigating Kelly\\'s death. Another cause of their suspicion: The rehab doctor said an embolism caused Kelly\\'s death, but the coroner says there\\'s no way he could have known that without doing an autopsy.

       " '– Scientists are \"very excited\" to learn more about a baby tooth that only the most sophisticated DNA dating tech can analyze. Some 150,000 years ago, a young girl lost her baby tooth, and it fell into the sediment of a cave in Siberia from which the first three (and thus far only) other fossils identified in 2010 as being Denisovan were found, reports Live Science. Before then, the hominin group that\\'s as genetically distinct from modern humans as Neanderthals was completely unknown. This fourth fossil is the oldest, per the paper in the Science Advances journal, suggesting that the mysterious group lived in Central Asia so long ago that there was likely greater interaction with, and thus more potential to interbreed with, Neanderthals—something we humans appear to have done, too. Five years ago, scientists would have probably had to destroy the tooth to study its genetic fingerprints, but recently Viviane Slon at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany was able to scrape the tooth\\'s surface and drill into its root to collect 10 milligrams of material that contained the DNA her team ultimately studied. \"We only have relatively little data from this archaic group, so having any additional individuals is something we\\'re very excited about,\" she tells the New York Times. The other three fossils, a finger bone and two molars, were also unearthed in the Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia. The baby tooth, found in deep sediment as much as 227,000 years old, is one of the oldest human specimens ever found in Central Asia.

Scientists tested the skin, blood, and urine of people before and after they handled receipts and other thermal papers that use bisphenol A as a print developer—and found that levels of the chemical rose, Forbes reports. Although the CDC won\\'t definitively acknowledge BPA\\'s risks—\"More research is needed\" is the official hedge on its fact sheet—WebMD points to various studies that have linked BPA to a variety of health issues, including a higher risk of cancer, heart problems, and brain and behavioral issues in babies and young children. Researchers who conducted the new study in PLoS One had participants handle receipt paper, then asked some of them to eat French fries using their hands. BPA levels in the skin spiked to 581 micrograms of BPA within 45 seconds (and 40% of that was absorbed in just two seconds). Urine and blood BPA levels were also strikingly higher 90 minutes after holding the receipts—and numbers here were on par with those from previous studies that were linked to Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, Forbes notes. Levels were even higher for subjects who had used hand sanitizer before handling the receipts; scientists attribute this to sanitizers (and toiletries like sunscreen and lotion) making hands more absorbent. Forbes notes the study was \"quite small and more research will be needed,\" while a spokesman for the American Chemistry Council notes the study\\'s \"unrealistic experimental conditions\" and that \"much of the data presented in this new study has very limited relevance to the potential for human exposure to BPA from handling thermal receipt paper.\" (Your BPA-free water bottle may still not be safe.)\\n',\n",

The photo\\'s caption identifies the men as members of the \"LGBTI community.\" The men say when the photo was shared around social media, it destroyed their lives. \"I don\\'t have a life anymore,\" one of them tells the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"I can\\'t go out.

Two of the six men say they were attacked by mobs yelling anti-gay slurs. Four say they were forced out of their homes by friends and family who didn\\'t know they were gay before the photo was published. All six have left their homes. A press officer for the US embassy, which hasn\\'t removed the photo, says it \"deeply regrets that any individuals were attacked based on any kind of orientation they might have.\" The embassy was given permission to publish the photo by the director of an Ivory Coast gay rights group.

So everything is backwards.\" Fisher disappointed her mom in one big way. Reynolds really wanted her to be a singer: \"The biggest thing that broke my mother’s heart was to not do a nightclub act,\" Fisher says in the film. \"My mother would say, ‘Do drugs—do whatever you do—but why don’t you sing?’ That was my big rebellion.\" Mother and daughter struggled with Fisher\\'s mental health challenges. \"Manic depressive is a disease,\" says a teary Reynolds in the film. \"Now that wasn’t diagnosed then, so nobody knew what was going on with Carrie. When she was 13, her personality changed. So it’s a constant battle—it takes all of us to assure her that she’s loved. It’s hard. It’s hard. That’s the hardest part.\" Fisher struggled with Reynolds\\' failing health. Vanity Fair says Reynolds is most vulnerable in the film while discussing Fisher\\'s mental health, and Fisher is most vulnerable when discussing the physical ailments her aging mother had been struggling with. They both joked prophetically about the future. At multiple points, both Fisher and Reynolds talk about their eventual deaths.

About 60% of the patients in the $100,000 group were taking at least 10 medicines from no fewer than four different prescribers, Reuters reports. \"Patients in these highest-spend categories are treating a complex condition along with other more common chronic conditions, such as diabetes or depression,\" an Express Scripts\\' head researcher says in a statement. A significant factor in the 63% increase of those dropping at least $50,000: More prescriptions are being issued for pricey specialty drugs for diseases such as hepatitis C and cancer, Reuters notes. Using info from 31.5 million insured Americans (covered by either commercial insurers or Medicaid/Medicare), the report also figured out the cost to payers for these pricey prescriptions: what the report labels \"an unsustainable\" $52 billion per year. But insurance picks up most of the tab, with plans covering almost 98% of the bill in the $100,000-plus group, per a press release.

The last confirmed sighting of him had been Nov. 3, 2015, when he told his wife he was going for a bike ride. Surveillance footage revealed that he had taken a ferry from Canada to Port Angeles in Washington state. The disappearance of Backer, who rowed for Canada in the 1984, 1988, and 1992 Olympics, became a criminal investigation within days after 15 investment clients—including friends, his brother, and his former coach, who lost $800,000—received letters confessing that his business was a pyramid scheme.

Matthew Bessler says Mike, his 10-year-old Belgian Malinois, was a combat dog who did bomb detection in Iraq before transitioning to civilian life, albeit with canine PTSD. \"I raised him and trained him as a puppy, and the ability he has to sense some of the issues that I have with seizures, with my PTSD, my TBI [traumatic brain injury] and severe anxiety disorders, how he can calm me down just by him being in my presence,\" the Army veteran tells the Billings Gazette. \"He can help take the focus and help change the focus of what’s going on with me and help me calm down or relax me.\" (The unique pair were featured in a Washington Post story this summer.) Now Bessler is questioning the official story that a passing cyclist killed Mike when the dog tried to attack him, the Powell Tribune reports. Bessler was away on a hunting trip when the cyclist passed the veteran\\'s house, drew a bike-mounted revolver, and opened fire (with birdshot, the cyclist says). The cyclist \"said he was genuinely in fear of his life and well-being, and the dog was \\'definitely in full attack mode and not backing down at all,\\'\" says a sheriff\\'s spokesman. Yet Mike was shot in the backside from 5 to 10 feet away, per the sheriff\\'s office. Bessler says he\\'s considering taking civil action, and is \"flabbergasted\" that \"a person would be carrying the types of things [the bicyclist] was carrying.\" Meanwhile, a GoFundMe page has reached its $10,000 goal to get Mike an animal autopsy and have him \"laid to rest with a military funeral and burial.\"\\n',\n",

I don\\'t know how to explain it.\" She said she urged her son to get psychological help, but he didn\\'t do it. Crying at traffic stop: Loughner got pulled over hours before the shooting for running a red light, and when the officer said he\\'d let him go with a warning, Loughner started to cry. \"So I asked him if he was OK,\" said the officer. \"And he said, \\'Yeah, I\\'m OK, I\\'ve just had a rough time and I really thought I was gonna get a ticket, and I\\'m really glad that you\\'re not.\\'\" His father: \"I tried to talk to him. But you can\\'t. He wouldn\\'t let you. Lost, lost and just didn\\'t want to communicate with me no more.\" On confiscating the gun: \"That totally set him over, I think.\" Childhood friend: \"I kicked him out of my house because he showed me his gun,\" Andrew Kuck told police, recalling a visit several weeks before the shooting when Loughner showed up armed. Loughner explained he had the gun for protection—he had grown paranoid about the police and others being out to get him—and gave Kuck\\'s roommate a souvenir bullet. Gabby Giffords connection: Another friend says Loughner, who had developed a hatred of government, once asked the visiting congresswoman, \"What is government and stuff?\" and didn\\'t get an an answer he liked. \"I feel like he had ... something against Gabrielle Giffords.\" Suicide call? The same friend says Loughner left him a phone message the morning of the shooting: \"He just said, \\'Hey, this is Jared. Um, we had some good times together. Uh, see you later.\\' And that\\'s it.\"\\n',\n",

Having technically drowned and suffered a heart attack, Eden Carlson was resuscitated after the February 2016 accident but completely unresponsive to stimuli for a month. Now, in what appears to be a world first, per Newsweek, researchers at the LSU Health New Orleans School of Medicine and the University of North Dakota School of Medicine report in Medical Gas Research that they have managed to reverse much of her white and gray matter brain damage using two types of non-invasive oxygen therapy. \"The startling regrowth of tissue ... occurred because we were able to intervene early in a growing child, before long-term tissue degeneration,\" says Paul Harch, who treated her, in an LSU release. MRI showed deep gray matter injury and both gray and white matter loss, and Eden was unresponsive, couldn\\'t walk or talk, and constantly squirmed. Since researchers started giving her normobaric oxygen therapy (sea-level amounts of oxygen) and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (pure oxygen at higher pressure) for 45 minutes twice a day, she stopped squirming, appeared more alert, began to laugh, and can now talk, climb stairs, and play, reports USA Today.

Another reason the speculation is ramping up: A number of reports on the topic cite unnamed sources close to him as well as his former law clerks who say they think he\\'s thinking about it. CNN uses the phrase \"seriously considering.\" And this from the AP: \"Kennedy and his clerks were gathering over the weekend for a reunion that was pushed up a year and helped spark talk he might be leaving the court.\" Bill Kristol put it at \"at least 50-50\" in a Saturday tweet. The Washington Examiner throws one more log on the fire, reporting Senate Judiciary Committee members Ted Cruz and Chuck Grassley previously expressed that they expect a seat to open up this summer. A piece from New Zealand\\'s Stuff calls Kennedy \"the man with the weight of America\\'s goofy-shaped democracy on his shoulders,\" and that points to just how pivotal he has been. CNN frames it like so: \"Like no other justice in recent history, Kennedy has cast the vital swing vote in cases that grab the [country\\'s] attention.\" Among the biggest: Obergefell v. Hodges, which allowed for same-sex marriage nationwide. On the flip side, CNN notes he wrote the majority opinion in Citizens United v. FEC, which axed election spending limits for corporations.

In that case, 3-year-old Hayden Nelson was allegedly left in a car outside Abundant Life Church for several hours by a family friend. Police explain the timeline, via the Arizona Republic: The child, mother Tiffani Nelson, and an 8-year-old sister spent the night at Courtney Arnold\\'s home. Arnold and Nelson both had choir practice to attend; because Nelson had to get there early, Arnold, 27, agreed to bring her own daughter, along with Nelson\\'s kids, later. AZFamily.com reports that Arnold arrived around 11am. In an emailed statement, police say \"indications are the suspect was a bit late and she and the other children exited the car. The suspect went immediately into the church for practice.\" Hayden was somehow left behind and spent three hours in the vehicle before his mother and churchmembers began searching for him. Outside temps at the time were as high as 96 degrees. The boy had stopped breathing, and died Sunday in the hospital. Prosecutors are still considering whether to bring charges against Arnold, though Officer James Holmes paints it as a tragic accident: \"It\\'s obvious that the 27-year-old forgot that the child was in the car.

That\\'s the repast writer Kristin Vukovic enjoyed at the Zasavica Special Nature Reserve in Serbia, where milk from the beasts of burden is used to make the world\\'s most expensive cheese. A small cupcake-sized mound of the stuff will set you back some $55. Writing for the BBC, Vukovic describes the cheese, which can cost $600 to more than $1,000 a pound, as \"sweet, clean, and mild, unlike any cheese I had ever tasted.\" (Another writer described the flavor of the \"magareci sir,\" aka \"pule cheese,\" as \"fusty-musty,\" per a 2012 New York Times piece.) Former politician Slobodan Simic started the Zasavica reserve about two decades ago. A few years after that, he rescued some abused Balkan donkeys. Now, the females in his herd of about 180 animals are responsible for supplying all the milk for the world\\'s donkey cheese supply, per the Mother Nature Network. Vitamin-rich, donkey milk has long been heralded as an immunity booster, anti-aging serum, and a kind of natural Viagra. More recently, Simic had the idea to start making cheese with the milk of donkeys. Because the milk is low in a protein needed to make cheese, it is mixed with goat\\'s milk—60/40, favoring donkey milk. Production of the donkey cheese is similar to that of goat cheese, Vukovic writes, but the \"exact method is a secret.\" As for why it\\'s so expensive, it takes 3 gallons of donkey milk to produce a pound of cheese, and female donkeys (who must be milked manually three times a day) don\\'t produce much milk. The cheese—which made headlines in 2012 on a rumor that tennis star Novak Djokovic was buying the whole year\\'s supply—isn\\'t the only donkey product Zasavica makes. The farm\\'s offerings include soap, face creams, and a donkey-milk liqueur. As for the sausage, Zasavica\\'s farm manager tells Vukovic that it is made from male donkeys that have taken on a taboo interest in their female offspring.

       " '– Chimpanzees are \"natural born killers,\" and their tendency toward lethal aggression is not a result of human influence, a new study finds. The study, published in Nature, looked at chimp-on-chimp killings in 18 chimp communities over a span of five decades and assessed how much those communities had been affected by human activities. Researchers found killings to be most common in the east African communities that had been least touched by humans, according to a press release. At the site most affected by human interference, in Guinea, no killings took place. \"Patterns of lethal aggression ... show little correlation with human impacts,\" the authors say, \"but are instead better explained by the adaptive hypothesis that killing is a means to eliminate rivals when the costs of killing are low.\" Researchers concluded that, in addition to eliminating rivals, chimps kill to get better mates, food, resources, or access to territory. The study bolsters evidence that such killings are an evolved, adaptive tactic as chimps seek to pass on their own genes, rather than a consequence of deforestation or humans studying and feeding chimps. The findings are particularly interesting because, as the Washington Post reports, chimpanzees are the only animals other than humans who \"go to war\" with each other. But the study—which refutes another high-profile study blaming human interference for chimps\\' warlike tendencies, the Chicago Tribune reports—has inspired some debate. Two anthropologists tell the New York Times the researchers didn\\'t actually establish that any of the communities studied were truly free from human interference.

       " '– Whether you have a high-pitched voice or a lower one, a new study suggests that it was probably evident when you were just a baby. As previous research has suggested voice pitch is unchanging in adulthood and nearly set in stone by age 7, researchers in France and the UK set out to explore just how early the pitch of one\\'s speech might be determined, per a release. Their study, published in the journal Biology Letters, reveals the pitch of babies\\' cries is \"a significant and substantial predictor of the pitch of their speech\" at age 5, per the New York Times. Given that research suggests a high-pitched voice is tied to less testosterone exposure in the womb, and vice versa, researchers say it\\'s possible that \"a substantial proportion\" of differences in voice pitch are determined in utero. \"In utero, you have a lot of different things that can alter and impact your life—not only as a baby, but also at an adult stage,\" says researcher Nicolas Mathevon, who compared the \"mild discomfort cries\" of 4- and 5-year-olds (six French girls and nine French boys) with the same children\\'s cries as infants. The results leads Discover to predict a future reality show following \"celebrity judges as they scour maternity wards … for the iconic voice of a new generation.\" But though the study is \"intriguing\" based on its suggestion \"that individual differences in voice pitch may have their origins very, very early in development,\" Carolyn Hodges of Boston University notes the small sample size raises the risk \"that it is not representative of the population as a whole.\" (Women may hear their voice drop after pregnancy.)\\n',\n",
       " \"– An unusual murder case in Indiana has prompted an unusual request from prosecutors: They want the judge to bar spectators in the courtroom from wearing buttons that express support or sympathy for accused killer Bei Bei Shuai, reports AP. They also want the defense to refrain from asking questions of witnesses that might elicit sympathy for Shuai, who is charged with killing her child by eating rat poison while 8 months' pregnant. It was a suicide attempt. Friends got Shuai to the hospital in time to save her, but not baby Angel, who was born days later. The trial starts April 22. The 2010 case has drawn international headlines. Shuai's supporters say that she was suffering depression when she attempted suicide and that convicting her of murder and feticide will theoretically open up such charges to any mother accused of providing improper care for her fetus. (A Change.org petition calling for Shuai's freedom has about 11,000 signatures.) Prosecutors say the case is straightforward: Shuai's suicide note made clear she was trying to kill her fetus along with herself, and that warrants the murder charges.\\n\",\n",

So suggests a new study in the Journal of Language and Social Psychology whose authors say that such \"filler words\" tend to be used by people who are more thoughtful than most, reports Research Digest. \"When having conversations with listeners, conscientious people use discourse markers, such as ‘I mean’ and ‘you know,’ to imply their desire to share or rephrase opinions to recipients,\" write the researchers. At New York, Melissa Dahl paraphrases: \"This is a person who is truly paying attention, to you and the conversation at hand,\" she writes. \"Conscientious people are careful, diligent individuals who are very concerned with doing things correctly—including, apparently, idle chitchat.\" They want to make sure their conversation partners are sticking with them and use such \"discourse fillers\" to help guide them along or to seek consensus.

She was 89. Cook died early Tuesday of respiratory failure at her home in Manhattan, surrounded by family and friends, according to her publicist. Her last meal was vanilla ice cream, a nod to one of her most famous roles in She Loves Me. On Broadway, Cook was best known for three roles: her portrayal of the saucy Cunegonde in Leonard Bernstein\\'s Candide (1956); librarian Marian, opposite Robert Preston in The Music Man (1957); and Amalia Balash, the letter-writing heroine of She Loves Me (1963). Yet when Cook\\'s ingenue days were over, she found a second, longer career in clubs and concert halls, working for more than 30 years with Wally Harper, a pianist and music arranger. Born in Atlanta in 1927, Cook hated vocal exercises and never had a vocal coach. \"I don\\'t remember when I didn\\'t sing. I just always sang,\" she said in 2011. \"I think I breathed and I sang.\" Cook made her Broadway debut in 1951\\'s Flahooley, a short-lived musical fantasy that became a cult classic, then turned to solo shows after her Broadway career withered in the late 1960s as she battled alcoholism and weight gain. She gave up drinking in the 1970s and, with the help of Harper, reinvented herself as a solo artist, working in small NYC clubs and finally Carnegie Hall. When asked what her advice usually was to aspiring singers, she once told the AP it boiled down to three words: \"You are enough. You are always enough. You don\\'t ever have to pretend to be anything other than what you are.\" Her marriage to acting teacher David LeGrant ended in divorce. Cook is survived by son Adam LeGrant.\\n',\n",
       " '– With scandal swirling around Donald Trump, do the Democrats have a chance at retaking control of the House of Representatives? An analysis at the Cook Political Report finds that it\\'s still quite a long shot to think that Democrats could manage the 30-seat gain they\\'d need. David Wasserman lays out a multitude of reasons why this is, but the numbers speak for themselves: There are only 37 competitive House races, and six of those are seats already held by Democrats. Of the rest, 18 are \"toss up\" states and 13 are \"lean Republican\" states. Even assuming the GOP maintains its majority in the House, questions are also swirling about what will become of Paul Ryan—like, for example, if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, will he even want to run for what could be a \"miserable\" term as speaker? More reading on both subjects: CNBC concurs that winning back control of the House wouldn\\'t be easy for Democrats, but argues that the hope of doing so \"isn\\'t so far-fetched.\" Politico lays out the plausible scenarios for Ryan\\'s future. One of them: If he does run for speaker again, he could have a hard time getting enough votes. There\\'s also the chance, albeit slim, he could quit Congress entirely. The Washington Post, however, talks to an assortment of insiders for a story suggesting that Ryan and a hypothetical President Clinton could find a way to work together. Ryan himself spoke Friday in Madison, Wis., against that hypothetical president, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. He did not mention Trump by name once, but decried Democrats\\' \"hubris\" and focused on Republicans maintaining control of the Senate. Speaking of the Senate, Bloomberg notes that though it\\'s an easier shot than the House (a net gain of four seats is needed), it will still be challenging for Democrats to retake that chamber.

Palin didn\\'t invent the phrase: As AOL News explains, it goes back to the Middle Ages, usually in reference to the myth that Jews used the blood of Christian children in rituals. It first got used in context with Arizona in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Monday, in which Glenn Reynolds blasted the criticism of Palin and others, asking, \"Where is the decency in blood libel?\" Much of the debate centers on whether Palin intentionally used it to be provocative, perhaps a testament to how her every utterance can drive a media conversation: Jonah Goldberg, National Review: \"I agree entirely with Glenn’s, and now Palin’s, larger point. But I’m not sure either of them intended to redefine the phrase, or that they should have.\" Ben Smith, Politico (via tweet): \"A quick \\'blood libel\\' thought.

The stunt at Hennessey’s Tavern in Dana Point, Calif., included handing out free drink \"green cards\" to customers who scaled the faux border wall, reports CBS News. Critics on social media are calling out the promotion as racist and offensive, but owner Paul Hennessey defended the ploy in a statement on Facebook. After thanking everyone for their comments, he writes, “Our intentions were to create a dialogue and show how ridiculous that it is to spend tens of millions of dollars to build a wall and even infer that Mexico foot some or the entire bill and have their citizens build it.” Hennessey adds that many have misunderstood his intent, and that he hopes people will spend equal time writing to Washington about President Trump\\'s proposed border wall as they do criticizing him on social media, ending with, “let’s stop this wall from being built.” But an employee who asked to remain anonymous said the tone of the event wasn’t so politically reflective, claiming the bar handed out mustaches while some customers yelled \"build the wall.\"\\n',\n",

But this summer in Japan, people are enjoying better living through chemistry with a new type of popsicle that basically doesn\\'t melt, even in super hot August temperatures, reports Quartz. The secret, it turns out, is in strawberries, which contain polyphenol—a liquid extract that makes it harder for oil and water to separate, and in turn essentially solidifies dairy cream, a Kanazawa University professor who developed the next-gen popsicle tells Asahi Shimbun. No one set out to make this a reality; it was actually a happy accident. Kanazawa-based Biotherapy Development Research Center was trying to use instead of waste the sub-par strawberries coming out of Miyagi Prefecture, which is still recovering from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The pastry chef charged with using strawberry polyphenol in confections complained that it made dairy cream solidify instantly, which struck the professor as potentially useful. After playing with many variations of milks, creams, and amounts of polyphenol and other ingredients, Tomihisa Ota hit upon the winning recipe, which has been sold as Kanazawa Ice since April.

In fact, the Palm Beach Post reports more than three times as many fishermen die from lightning strikes than golfers. A study published in Geophysical Research Letters in February and recently getting some attention may explain why. Researchers from the Florida Institute of Technology found that lightning strikes over the ocean can be much more powerful than strikes over land. It's the first independent study to show what others have long believed, according to a press release. Researchers studied lightning over Florida and its coasts from 2013 to 2015, measuring the peak currents of the strikes. They found strikes over the ocean carried more charge than those over land. In fact, they estimated that lightning with peak currents of more than 50 kilo amperes is more than twice as likely to occur over the ocean. This could mean people living on or near the ocean may be at greater risk from lightning. Worth noting: Deaths from lightning strikes in Florida—a state with a whole lot of coastline—regularly outpace those in the rest of the country. Nine people were killed by lightning in 2016 in Florida. (Pain is only the beginning of a lightning strike.)\\n\",\n",

       " '– Scientists are taking a closer look at Uranus after strange patterns turned up in images from 30 years ago. Engadget reports that researchers looking at data from NASA\\'s Voyager 2—which became the only spacecraft ever to fly by Uranus when it did so in 1986—noticed that the amount of material in some of the planet\\'s rings varies from time time. This pattern of shifting material was present in two of the Uranus\\' 13 rings, according to Gizmodo. \"There\\'s something breaking the symmetry,\" researcher Matt Hedman says in a press release. He and fellow researcher Rob Chancia believe that something is two undiscovered moons. The idea is that the two new moons—which would bring Uranus\\' total up to 29—are orbiting outside the planet\\'s rings, leaving wakes behind them, according to a study being published soon. Similar things called moonlet wakes occur in Saturn\\'s rings. Researchers estimate the new moons circling Uranus are between 2 miles and 9 miles across—smaller than any of Uranus\\' other moons. \"We haven\\'t seen the moons yet, but the idea is the size of the moons needed to make these features is quite small, and they could have easily been missed,\" Hedman says in the press release. The new moons may also be responsible for keeping Uranus\\' rings in check, which would explain why they are narrower than those of Saturn. (Another study found Saturn\\'s rings and moons are younger than dinosaurs.)\\n',\n",

In Karachi, troops and police were able to stop the crowd—estimated by some at 15,000—from reaching the US consulate.

Independent bookstores may be inefficient from a financial perspective, but that doesn\\'t mean they\\'re \"doomed,\" he writes at Slate. If we want to keep such bookstores going, we can\\'t just go and browse: We need to buy, and that means they need to sell better. It\\'s time for them to start innovating the way Amazon has: \"Tablets and smartphones could be store owners’ best weapons against Jeff Bezos—if only they’d embrace them.\" Many readers turn to the online retail giant for its well-crafted review system, which is free to use—why not co-opt it? Bookstores could highlight books that have gotten good reviews on Amazon, Manjoo suggests. And shops should try out AisleBuyer, which lets indie stores create their own apps. Customers can buy with their phones in-store; shops can track customer purchases to make recommendations. Apps could also help them connect staff to customers with matching interests. To store owners: \"Amazon is stealing your customers. This is a way to fight back.\"\\n',\n",

That detail comes from a 29-page interim report released today by France\\'s BEA crash investigation agency; it describes how Lubitz, flying from Dusseldorf to Barcelona, put the plane in a \"controlled descent that lasted for minutes and for which there was no aeronautical justification\" on the same day that he brought the plane down on its return journey. The AP reports the pilot had left Lubitz alone in the cockpit, during which time he moved the plane into descent mode five times in less than five minutes. After each descent, he brought the plane back up to regular altitude. \"I can\\'t speculate on what was happening inside his head; all I can say is that he changed this button to the minimum setting of 100 feet and he did it several times,\" says BEA\\'s director. The Wall Street Journal specifies that during a 4.5-minute period, Lubitz keyed in altitudes ranging from 1,000 feet to 49,000 feet. Investigators say the adjustments were made while the plane was descending from 37,000 feet to 35,000, so they apparently went undetected by the captain and others on the flight; air traffic controllers didn\\'t notice them, per the New York Times.

It is called, awesomely, Elfdalian, reports the Local. Those hoping for a Tolkien-esque link will be disappointed to learn that it has nothing to do with elves but instead translates to \"river valley.\" About 2,500 people are estimated to speak Elfdalian, but only about 60 kids— hence the push to teach it in preschool in Alvdalen. Linguists once thought Elfdalian was just another Swedish dialect, but they have since concluded that it\\'s a distinct language, most likely a descendant of the Viking language Old Norse that broke off from Swedish around 1300, reports the Financial Times in a previous story. One reason: While Swedes can understand speakers of different dialects, they\\'re clueless when it comes to Elfdalian, in part because it has grammatical characteristics not found in other Scandinavian languages. \"Elfdalian is a a goldmine,\" says one historian. \"It works almost like a linguistic deep freeze, where one can get a glimpse of Old Norse traits that have long since vanished in the other Nordic languages.\" A conference later this week at Copenhagen University will focus on Elfdalian, led by a professor at Lund University who taught himself how to speak it. He loves the preschool idea: \"In the past, children from this area didn\\'t go far beyond the farms they lived on, but now they go to school and consume so much other media that it is hard for them to keep Elfdalian as their main language.\"\\n',\n",

The ordinance in question was passed unanimously earlier this month by San Francisco\\'s Board of Supervisors, and when it takes effect within the next month or so (the New York Times says July; TechCrunch says Aug. 1), Airbnb and other online rental marketplaces will have to ensure hosts renting out their homes are registered with the city. If the company doesn\\'t comply, it can be fined $1,000 per unregistered host per day or be forced to scrub its site of those listings. But in a blog post, Airbnb says \"unfortunately, the rules do not work,\" and CNNMoney notes a registration process that may \"turn off\" some hosts, including a $50 fee and a mandate that all paperwork be turned in in person. Specifically, the company claims the law will put some San Francisco residents at risk of eviction or foreclosure because of \"confusing\" registration rules, and that the ordinance would violate the 1996 Communications Decency Act and the Stored Communications Act, which, respectively, protect websites from liability due to user content and from having to hand over consumer info without appropriate legal measures.

But critics say the event has become too expensive, resembles a carnival, and hasn\\'t had a stellar success rate at predicting how well hopefuls will eventually do: The Post points out that Michele Bachmann emerged victorious in the 2011 poll held in Ames, then finished last in the 2012 caucuses; it\\'s actually only been right about the GOP nominee twice.

Most prices are slated to rise 5%, while Stocks Beat says the pain drug Lyrica will go up 9% and Viagra nearly 13%.

Dawn Gentry says she was on the slide with her daughter on July 27 when the raft flew off the tracks on the ride\\'s second drop. \"The lifeguards were freaking out,\" she tells the Star, adding that she got the impression it had happened before. Sara Craig, a visitor who returned when the park reopened Wednesday, tells the AP that she went down the ride twice a few weeks ago with her son and one of his friends. She says it was \"very, very rough\" and her Velcro shoulder restraint came off during her first trip. Craig also says operators allowed her group to go down the slide with a combined weight of 393 pounds, below the 400 minimum.\\n',\n",

Now the Mesa Police Department has placed a police sergeant and three officers on administrative leave while the incident is investigated, CNN reports. Even so, the Mesa Police Association says Johnson \"was not compliant and physically resisted what we feel was a lawful detention.\" Johnson, 33, was at the apartment building where he lives, but he was accompanying a friend who, police say, was attempting to get into an ex-girlfriend\\'s apartment just before midnight. Police responded to the scene after someone called 911 and said there was possibly a weapon at the apartment. The officers approached Johnson and the friend, searched Johnson and found him unarmed, then asked him to sit down by the wall. Instead, he leaned against the wall. In bodycam video released by the police department, police can be heard telling Johnson to sit down before starting to hit him, AZFamily.com reports. Police Chief Ramon Batista says the fact that Johnson was leaning against the wall and what he said to the officers made them feel he needed to sit down, though Batista didn\\'t reveal what Johnson allegedly said. And the police union says the surveillance video that was released \"does not include the full context of the encounter.\" But Johnson\\'s lawyer insists his client \"wasn\\'t resisting. He was unarmed and then they just attacked.\" Batista says he\\'s \"disappointed\" by what the video shows and that the department will instruct officers not to hit anyone in the head if the person isn\\'t attempting to harm them.

The AP reports the bid would apparently be an attempt to keep Sinclair Broadcast Group, which is also rumored to be pursuing Tribune, from snatching up Tribune\\'s stakes in Food Network, WGN cable network, and the local stations. Bloomberg reports Sinclair had been looking at offering something in the neighborhood of the high-$30s per share. Sinclair has 173 local television stations in 81 markets, and CNN Money notes that if its bid is successful it would be in violation of current FCC rules in that it would reach more than 40% of the US television market. But Variety sets the stage: Sinclair\\'s move is \"part of another wave of broadcast TV station mergers expected now that the FCC is on a course to loosen ownership restrictions.\" It also calls Fox\\'s rumored move an \"offensive\" one, as if Sinclair were to be successful, its control over Fox affiliates would swell to 28%.

Them boys didn't rape her. She wanted this to happen. I'm not taking nobody's side, but if she hadn't put herself in that predicament, this would have never happened,” said one resident. Many others who attended a town meeting also told reporters the 11-year-old had consented to sex with those accused, the AP reports via the Houston Chronicle. The meeting was supposedly held to discuss concerns about the investigation, but many in attendance used it to voice claims that the 11-year-old was to blame because of the way she dressed, or to hypothesize that she lied about her age. Others opposed those views, noting that Texas’s age of consent is 17, and that even if the girl did claim to be older, an 11-year-old simply cannot legally give consent. Quanell X, the Houston activist who led the meeting, said he “did not come here this evening to jump on an 11-year-old girl,” but also questioned why the girl didn’t report the attack herself.

In Slate, Dana Stevens calls the film an \"insurmountable ziggurat of featureless prose, a run-of-the-mill serial-killer whodunit spiked with generous doses of nasty sexual violence.\" Sure, \"Fincher is a master of mood and atmosphere, but this chilly, efficient movie never transcends the shallowness of its source material.\" Peter Travers sees the film as a \"letdown\"—\"a faithful adaptation that brings the dazzle but shortchanges on the daring.\" It may be \"gloriously rendered,\" but it\\'s \"too impersonal to leave a mark.\" Still, \"Mara is astonishing,\" he writes in Rolling Stone. \"There are waves of brilliantly orchestrated anxiety and confusion but also long stretches of drab, hackneyed exposition that flatten the atmosphere,\" notes AO Scott in the New York Times. \"We might be watching Cold Case or Criminal Minds, but with better sound design and more expressive visual techniques.\" The New Yorker is less down on the film (though the review itself sparked controversy).

There are believed to be 165 million tons of it in the ocean right now. We\\'re dumping the equivalent of one garbage truck\\'s worth into the ocean per minute; that\\'s projected to jump to four per minute by 2050, according to a report released Tuesday by the World Economic Forum and Ellen MacArthur Foundation. And that report has an ominous warning: We\\'re on track to have more plastic than fish, by weight, in the world\\'s oceans by 2050. (Right now, the ratio is about 1:5, plastics to fish.) And the discarded plastic that doesn\\'t end up in the ocean is likely be put in a landfill; those two resting places end up holding about 70% of our plastic, the Washington Post reports. Just 5% of plastics are effectively recycled, according to the Guardian. It\\'s not just a problem of pollution. \"After a short first-use cycle, 95% of plastic packaging material value, or $80 to $120 billion annually, is lost to the economy,\" the report says.

It was Heinrich who had finally led authorities to Jacob\\'s body, and on Tuesday he recounted the wrenching details of the 1989 abduction, reports the Minneapolis Star Tribune. While driving on a dead-end street, he came across three boys on their bikes, and forced two of them—Jacob\\'s brother and a friend—to run away. Then he put Jacob in the front seat and handcuffed him. \"What did I do wrong?\" he said the boy asked. Heinrich made Jacob duck down in the seat because he had a police scanner and could hear reports coming in about the abduction. He drove to an area near a gravel pit, molested the boy, then told Jacob he would drive him part of the way home. When Jacob started crying, “I panicked,\" said Heinrich. \"I pulled the revolver out of my pocket. ... I loaded it with two rounds. I told Jacob to turn around,” Heinrich said. He shot the boy twice and left, but returned later to dispose of his body. He actually buried the boy twice—Heinrich said the first location wasn\\'t hidden enough, so he removed the remains and reburied them on a farm. The break in the case came when a review of DNA evidence with new technology linked Heinrich to another old assault. That led to a search warrant and the discovery of child pornography, and Heinrich eventually confessed.\\n',\n",

He needed to get 50% of the vote, and the nation's election commission says he got 50.03%. That translates to 4,099 votes out of 12.3 million cast, reports AP. If the decision stands—it's still unclear whether opponent Raila Odinga will challenge the results—Kenyatta will simultaneously have to govern the country and work on his defense on charges of crimes against humanity. He is due to face trial in July at the International Criminal Court in the Hague, reports the Voice of Russia. Those charges stem from violence that erupted after the last presidential election in 2007. Kenyatta is among those accused of orchestrating mass killings and rapes that left more than 1,000 people dead after the disputed election. His running mate in this year's election, William Ruto, faces similar charges at the ICC.\\n\",\n",

ScarJo \"is pissed that he\\'s not under her spell anymore,\" and equally unhappy that he has started dating Blake Lively, a source tells Us. \"She realized what a great catch Ryan was.\" Reynolds would have happily reunited with Scarlett after she initiated their divorce, the source continues—until Scarlett \"flaunted Sean [Penn] right after their split, and he was done.\" The New York Post points out that Scarlett herself sounds regretful while discussing her marriage in the new issue of Cosmopolitan. She calls it \"the best thing I ever did,\" continuing, \"getting married was the right thing to do because it was natural. It grew out of a romance and love and a desire to have a future with somebody and I was very fortunate that I married somebody who turned out to be the person I thought he would be.\" As for why it failed, \"I wasn\\'t prepared to hunker down and do the work.\"\\n',\n",

Under pressure to remove Bill Cosby’s star in the face of rape allegations and his recently revealed testimony about giving women Quaaludes, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce confirms that the 38-year-old plaque is not going anywhere. \"The answer is no,\" president and CEO Leron Gubler declares, according to NBC News. \"Once a star has been added to the Walk, it is considered a part of the historic fabric of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\" Indeed, the iconic sidewalk would feature a few holes if stars were removed after a celebrity’s fall from grace. Musician, actor, and convicted murderer Spade Cooley has a star on Hollywood Boulevard, for instance. Another organization that will not cut ties with Cosby is the Smithsonian Institution. Its National Museum of African Art has been showcasing the Cosbys\\' considerable collection since November and a museum official tells the AP the exhibition will not be pulled. \"First and fundamentally, this is an art exhibit,\" says Richard Kurin, the Smithsonian\\'s art, history, and culture undersecretary. \"So it\\'s not about the life and career of Bill Cosby. It\\'s about the artists.\" The AP notes that Camille Cosby sits on the museum\\'s advisory board and facilitated the loan of the art pieces, and that the Cosbys donated $716,000 toward the exhibition—essentially funding the project. Kurin, who has worked for the Smithsonian for decades, says the Smithsonian has never taken down a full exhibit. (Cosby\\'s \"pound cake\" speech came back to bite him.)\\n',\n",

Lake County Major Crimes Task Force commander George Filenko says the probe points to \"criminal activity on the part of at least two other individuals,\" and a source tells NBC Chicago that Gliniewicz\\'s wife, Mel, and son, DJ, are under investigation. Their names surface again in a Sun-Times report, which identifies them, via a source, as the \"Individual 1\" and \"Individual 2,\" respectively, who exchanged revealing texts with Gliniewicz. New Village Administrator Anne Marrin had been pressing Gliniewicz about the Explorer program up until the day before his death, and texts allegedly make reference to her. \"This situation right here would give her the means to crucify me if it were discovered,\" Gliniewicz wrote. When Individual 2 expressed hope that Marrin \"decides to get a couple of drinks in her and she gets a DUI,\" Gliniewicz replied, \"Trust me, I\\'ve thought it through. Many scenarios, from planting things, to the Volo bog\"—the latter being local parkland, per the Sun-Times. Meanwhile, the 100 Club of Chicago, which offers money to the families of officers killed in the line of duty, has for the first time in its history asked for its $15,000 back. \"In this case it was not a line-of-duty death.

Expect to hear a lot in coming days about issues such as women\\'s health services, equal pay, and flexible work hours for working moms.

If Donald Trump oversteps his constitutional authority and the \"feckless, spineless Congress we have\" won\\'t remove him, \"what patriot will step up and do that if he oversteps his mandate as president?\" Thor asked. \"I don\\'t think there is a legal means available,\" he added.

Yet Wilson tweeted back that it was somewhat of a \"grey area,\" splitting hairs on whether the movies those actresses had starred in fell under the \"studio rom-com with sole lead\" category, and whether the actresses had actually been plus-size during filming. Making things worse, per Monique Judge on the Root: Wilson seemed to only respond to white women who corrected her on Twitter, while blocking black women who did so (the Daily Dot notes a #RebelWilsonBlockedMe hashtag emerged). Mo\\'Nique herself responded, tweeting: \"Take a moment and know the history. DON\\'T BE A PART OF ERASING IT.\" Wilson issued an apology, per the Sydney Morning Herald, noting that \"in a couple of well-intentioned moments ... I neglected to show the proper respect to those who climbed this mountain before me like Mo\\'Nique, Queen Latifah, Melissa McCarthy, Ricki Lake, and likely many others.\" As for the Twitter blocking, she said it was \"because I was hurting from the criticism, but those are the people I actually need to hear from more, not less. Again, I am deeply sorry.\" (Wilson had a record defamation payout—and then didn\\'t.)\\n',\n",

From 2013 to 2014, Sea Star Wasting Syndrome hit sea stars from British Columbia to Mexico. The starfish would develop lesions, then disintegrate, their arms turning into blobs of goo. The cause is unclear, but researchers say it may be a virus, per the AP. Now, however, the species is rebounding. Sea stars are being spotted in Southern California tide pools and elsewhere, the Orange County Register reports. \"They are coming back, big time,\" says Darryl Deleske, an aquarist for LA\\'s Cabrillo Marine Aquarium. \"It\\'s a huge difference. A couple of years ago, you wouldn\\'t find any.\" Similar die-offs of starfish on the West Coast were reported in the 1970s, \\'80s, and \\'90s, but the latest outbreak was far larger and more widespread, per a report by University of California-Santa Cruz researchers. Beginning with ochre stars off Washington state, the disease spread, killing off mottled stars, leather stars, sunflower stars, rainbows, and six-armed stars. It hit Southern California by December 2013. \"When it did [arrive], you just started to see them melt everywhere,\" says Deleske. \"You\\'d see an arm here, an arm there.\" The recovery has been promising. Four adult sea stars, each about 7 to 8 inches long, were spotted this month at Crystal Cove State Park in Newport Beach. The stars aren\\'t out of danger yet, though. The wasting syndrome never completely disappeared in Northern and central California, and it\\'s reappeared in the Salish Sea region of Washington, per a recent report.

Fly to St. Louis to visit his 96-year-old mother, who never doubted his innocence. Wilson, now 62, was convicted in 1986 of stabbing a man sleeping in a truck in Los Angeles, KABC reports. According to the Los Angeles Times, the victim had a disorder that kept his blood from clotting. For the past three decades, Wilson has maintained that he didn\\'t do it. And while his actual innocence is still up in the air, it\\'s now official that he didn\\'t receive a fair trial. The DA\\'s office has admitted that \"cumulative errors\" added up to an unfair trial for Wilson. Those errors include allegedly withholding evidence that the victim\\'s girlfriend—the only witness to the crime—had previously filed a false police report regarding kidnapping and rape. Also allegedly withheld: evidence that an LAPD detective directed the girlfriend to a photo of Wilson and that a friend suspected the victim\\'s girlfriend, as she had stabbed the victim in the past. The prosecutor in the murder case denies withholding evidence, and the DA\\'s office maintains that Wilson murdered the victim (though it doesn\\'t plan to retry him).

He says he was told by Raja Rao, who was hanged by the British in 1857, that the gold was there and should be given to the government. And there might actually be something there.

India Today reports that drilling machines that made two holes there last week had hit something that seemed \"different\" at that level.

According to WFAA, the Moldovans claimed Polito was demanding \"unreasonable fees\"—despite it being included in the contract they signed. Polito says she was prepared to absorb the $125 charge to keep the couple happy; instead they went public. On local news and online, the Moldovans claimed Polito \"cheated\" and \"scammed\" them. Neely Moldovan used her position as a blogger to amplify the story, Polito says. \"Statements like, \\'I\\'m pretty sure her business is ruined,\\' \\'I hope this goes viral,\\' \\'feeling excited,\\' and \\'justice has been served\\' are not the actions of a concerned and hurt bride,\" PetaPixel quotes Polito as saying. \"They are actions of an individual trying to take someone down.\" Polito filed a $1 million defamation lawsuit in 2015, and a jury ruled in her favor Friday, awarding her $1.08 million.

Paintings poking fun at the anti-gay law and at the head of the Russian Orthodox church were also seized. The owner of the \"Museum of Authority\" says police officers shut down his gallery and didn\\'t give him an explanation for the seizure—or a receipt for the petty cash they took. \"I\\'m very afraid in this situation,\" he tells the Wall Street Journal. \"Because today the authorities can do whatever they want.\" The police say they raided the gallery after receiving complaints about illegal paintings. It\\'s not clear what laws were broken, although insulting the authorities is a crime that carries up to a one-year sentence in Russia.\\n',\n",

The Guardian reports that more than 700 people suspected of dealing or using drugs have been killed since Duterte, nicknamed \"the Punisher,\" was elected after vowing to kill tens of thousands of criminals. Critics including Sen. Leila de Lima, a former justice minister, say police and vigilantes are using an anti-drugs campaign as an excuse to kill innocent people. \"We cannot wage the war against drugs with blood. We will only be trading drug addiction with another more malevolent kind of addiction,\" she told lawmakers recently. \"This is the compulsion for more killing.\" Rights groups believe the rate of killing has reached dozens a day. A group of Filipino human rights advocates issued a statement last week condemning the killings and accusing police of \"turning low-income neighborhoods in the country into free-fire zones.\" \"The bloody encounters taking place daily have polarized the country between those who support the president\\'s quick and dirty methods of dealing with drugs and crime, and those who regard them as illegal, immoral, and self-defeating,\" the statement said. Reuters reports that one recent victim was Michael Siaron, a 29-year-old pedicab driver shot dead in Manila by men on motorcycles. After photos of Siaron being cradled by his widow went viral, Duterte said the pictures were \"melodramatic.\" The widow admitted that Siaron used drugs but said he was far too poor to have been a dealer—and that he voted for Duterte.\\n',\n",

Users manipulate a big onscreen hand to beat a model, with their score advancing from “100% pussy” to “100% gangsta” with every new bruise. But when one reaches “100% gangsta,” the screen in fact changes to “100% idiot”—the only indication it is indeed anti-violence, AdFreak reports.

       " \"– The US is the only country out of 38 that doesn't require paid maternity leave, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study. And while the US Family and Medical Leave Act does provide for up to 12 weeks of leave for some employees with a new baby or other qualifying family situation, it's unpaid leave. A global telecom company, however, has decided it's not waiting for mandates from each of its affiliate nations, including the US: Vodafone will offer 16 paid weeks of maternity leave, covering new moms in the US, Africa, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region, and Europe, CBS News reports. And once moms are back behind the desk, the company takes its progressive policy one step further, paying a mother's full salary for a 30-hour workweek for the first six months. The changes will be implemented by the end of 2015, the Wall Street Journal reports. KPMG research commissioned by Vodafone estimated that businesses offering 16 paid weeks would dole out $28 billion a year globally for the benefits. But it also found that by saving $47 billion by not having to recruit and train new employees taking over for moms opting out of the workforce, companies would save $19 billion a year collectively. Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao also thinks that since fewer moms will permanently off-ramp, his company can boost more women who work there (35% of its employees) into upper-management roles—only 21% of its international upper ranks are currently made up of women.

Some early reactions to the historic victory: Trump\\'s \"astonishing\" victory \"is the greatest upset in the modern history of American elections—convulsing the nation’s political order in ways so profound and disruptive its impact can’t even be guessed at,\" writes Glenn Thrush at Politico. He was able to defeat \"a better-funded, better-organized Hillary Clinton by surfing a tsunami of working-class white rage that her army of numbers crunchers somehow missed,\" Thrush writes. What Trump \"has done is nothing short of cataclysmic,\" writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. \"He has fundamentally reshaped the political map. He has broken the Republican Party into pieces—and its shards still remain scattered everywhere. He has proven that the political polling and punditry industries need a deep re-examination.\" But beyond that, Cillizza writes, the victory shows that \"many of the assumptions that people have long made about who we are as a country and what we want out of our politicians, our political system and each other are, frankly, wrong.\" Conor Friedersdorf at the Atlantic says that he hopes Trump will \"rise to the occasion\"—but to be on the safe side, people should start thinking now about how to thwart Trump \"misbehavior.\" \"The most important project in American politics for the next four years is safeguarding the rights conferred by the Constitution and the norms of a liberal society,\" he writes. \"The effort expended by ordinary citizens will determine the odds of that project’s success.\" Jim Rutenberg at the New York Times sees the media\\'s failure to see what was happening leading up to the Trump win as not just a failure of polling, but a failure \"to capture the boiling anger of a large portion of the American electorate that feels left behind by a selective recovery, betrayed by trade deals that they see as threats to their jobs and disrespected by establishment Washington, Wall Street and the mainstream media.\" Trump didn\\'t just \"vanquish\" Clinton, writes Gerald F. Seib at the Wall Street Journal. He \"instantly remade the Republican party in his own image. He rewrote some of the GOP’s most dearly held policy and philosophical positions.\" Trump has sent the capital into a \"zone of uncertainty the likes of which it hasn’t experienced at least since Ronald Reagan’s conservative revolution in 1980,\" and is about to become \"the most unconventional president in modern American history,\" Seib writes.\\n',\n",

According to the detailed roadmap, TEPCO intends to spend the next two years clearing the spent fuel rods out of the storage pools situated in the reactor buildings; but the lion's share of the time will go to removing the melted nuclear fuel. That process will take some 25 years, and will necessitate the use of robots—and technologies that haven't even been invented yet, reports the New York Times. The Wall Street Journal zeroes in on one of the toughest steps in the process: Figuring out how to drain thousands of tons of irradiated water from the reactor buildings' basements. The cracks that the earthquake created in these buildings will then be repaired, allowing the reactors to be refilled with water, which must occur before the melted fuel can be removed from them. Once that process is complete, it'll be another five to 10 years until the reactors are completely decommissioned.\\n\",\n",

Sources say the younger Flynn had been in the process of getting a security clearance to join his father at the National Security Council, but was fired because of his tweets about the \"PizzaGate\" fake news story. Flynn Jr. continued to tweet in support of the conspiracy theory even after a gunman stormed a pizzeria in Washington, DC, on Sunday, looking for children he thought were being kept as sex slaves by top Democrats. Mike Pence told CNN Tuesday that Flynn Jr. was no longer part of the transition, but declined to say whether the team had been seeking security clearance for him. \"All of our families want to be helpful, and four weeks to the day from Election Day, we\\'ve got a lot of work to do,\" Pence told Jake Tapper. \"But Mike Flynn Jr. is no longer associated with Gen.

According to Fortune, all but one family in the village are retired. Prior to reunification, the village 75 miles south of Berlin was owned by a coal briquette plant, which closed in 1991, leading many residents to seek out jobs elsewhere. Alwine was bought by two brothers in 2000, but they had little luck changing its fortunes.

They\\'ll also be testing a new FAQ page, and it\\'s an unusual one that distances CERN from demons and Satan. Since the LHC began smashing particles together, conspiracy theorists have suggested physicists were about to open a door to another dimension, allowing apocalyptic forces to reach our planet, reports the Wall Street Journal. An editorial in Michigan\\'s Daily Reporter in September noted CERN \"could easily and suddenly, without warning, destroy our universe.\" A few pointed out that CERN\\'s logo included the 666 sign of the Antichrist. Then there was the group who planned to protest the smashing of particles at CERN. \"I guess they more or less see particles as planets with very small \\'people\\' on them,\" a rep says. \"It got to the point where there really needed to be some intervention,\" says CERN\\'s social media rep. The FAQ page, born in September, not only describes CERN\\'s logo as depicting particle accelerators rather than a sign of Satan, it also clarifies that \"CERN will not open a door to another dimension,\" though physicists can test for particles that may suggest extra dimensions exist. The nice thing is that the page can always be updated, says a rep. For example, it doesn\\'t yet address rumors of \"occult symbolism\" hidden in a dance opera filmed inside CERN.

A look around the blogosphere: Some of Cain\\'s Tea Party and evangelical supporters may end up choosing Michele Bachmann or Rick Santorum, but rising Mitt Romney alternative Newt Gingrich is best placed to benefit, decides Molly Ball at the Atlantic.

Cain\\'s exit would be good news for Gingrich, and very bad news for Romney, writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. Romney\\'s stagnant poll numbers suggest that his only chance of winning the nomination will be if conservatives \"fracture among several candidates rather than unify behind a single one,\" he writes. Cain dropping out could actually work in Romney\\'s favor, according to Philip Klein at the Washington Examiner. The spotlight could shift to Gingrich\\'s \"messy personal life, three marriages, and extramarital affair,\" he writes, and while Romney probably won\\'t directly attack Gingrich over his personal life, don\\'t be surprised if he starts mentioning his 42-year marriage a lot more often.\\n',\n",

Residential customers who sign up for Informed Delivery will receive a daily email with high-quality photo scans of their incoming envelope fronts, reports NBC News. The emails display up to 10 images—if there are more than 10 on a given day, the rest can be viewed via a link that stays active for seven days. After receiving “tremendously positive” feedback in pilot test runs, executive program director Bob Dixon says the program has been particularly appealing to people living with roommates, since they’re not always first to retrieve their daily mail. Frequent travelers are another group utilizing the service, which Dixon personally attests to as one of Informed Delivery’s first users. He tells NPR that he was able to flag a jury duty summons while on the road and asked his son to set it aside so it didn’t get lost in a towering mail pile. With the rate of mail delivery declining (61.2 billion pieces of first-class mail were handled by USPS in 2016 compared to 98 billion in 2006), the service is one way the post office is innovating and trying to remain relevant. \"Our emerging consumers, younger folks, are digital natives,\" Dixon says. \"That\\'s how their communications are coming to them.\" USPS has opened sign-up for Informed Delivery at: informeddelivery.USPS.com.

The BBC reports wild mallard ducks have been spotted eating other birds, swallowing one nearly whole, an \"extraordinary\" behavior that has never been observed before. Zoologist Silviu Petrovan of the University of Cambridge was birdwatching at a reservoir in Romania when he spotted a flock of mallards hunting a fledgling that had landed on the water. A female duck grabbed the grey wagtail in her beak, dunked it several times beneath the water, then ate it, Petrovan says. A black redstart landed soon after and \"was almost instantaneously attacked\" by 10 juveniles, per the study in the journal Waterbirds. Though mallards in California have been sighted munching on sand crabs, the ducks usually eat plants, insects, and the occasional small fish. As far as scientists can tell, such predatory behavior not involving fish or amphibians has never been seen before. It\\'s not only \"very rare\" but also likely a new phenomenon, says Petrovan, noting mallards have \"not ... really evolved\" to digest bones and feathers. \"The mallard was massively struggling to eat that wagtail, presumably because it couldn\\'t actually tear it to pieces\" due to the design of its bill. So why would a duck eat a bird at all? Petrovan suggests \"pressure for those fast-growing juveniles to get animal protein intake.\" (These birds are probably safe.)\\n',\n",

A new study out of Carnegie Mellon University, however, suggests that the opposite is true, according to a post at Phys.org. In their experiment, researchers asked one group of married couples to have twice as much weekly sex as usual over a three-month period, and they gave no instructions to a second group. All the couples filled out surveys along the way, and, as Bustle notes, \"this is where things get weird.\" Those who had double the amount of sex reported lower levels of sexual enjoyment and happiness at the end of the experiment than they did at the beginning. The lead researcher is the first to acknowledge that the reason might be because the couples were instructed to have more sex as part of a research experiment, not the most thrilling of circumstances. He elaborates, with some oddly specific advice: \"If we ran the study again, and could afford to do it, we would try to encourage subjects into initiating more sex in ways that put them in a sexy frame of mind, perhaps with baby-sitting, hotel rooms, or Egyptian sheets, rather than directing them to do so.\" Another researcher adds that couples should be less focused on numbers and more on creating the right environment when they do have sex. Or as Wired sums up: \"The moral of the story, folks, is that it\\'s all about quality over quantity.\" (Another study finds that millennials will have fewer sexual partners than their parents.)\\n',\n",

They can go from green and blue hues to yellow and red ones in a matter of minutes, and scientists say they now think they know how. Reporting in Nature Communications, researchers say that instead of relying on pigments, these reptiles also boast nanocrystals called iridophores beneath their skin, which contract or expand to essentially reflect different levels of light. To study this, the researchers observed the male panther chameleon of Madagascar—which isn\\'t easy given how skilled they are at shade shifting. \"I assure you: In Madagascar, they are really difficult to spot,\" study co-author Michel Milinkovitch, a biophysicist at the University of Geneva, tells the Los Angeles Times. By filming color changes and examining the chameleons\\' skin using transmission electron microscopy, the scientists were able to see two layers of skin with iridophores. It turns out that tiny guanine nanocrystals boast very specific spacing between each crystal that in turn reflects different layers of light—shorter spacing reflects blue light, longer spacing red. By interacting with yellow pigment cells (xanthophores) in the skin, greens and oranges emerge. What\\'s more, some less-organized crystal spacing may even reflect near-infrared light, helping to cool the chameleons. \"We need to continue investigating the chameleons,\" Milinkovitch adds, \"because part of the answers are there and nowhere else.\" (Chameleons don\\'t necessarily boast longevity.)\\n',\n",

A new study from researchers at Brigham Young and Colorado State found that people who can hear the sounds of their own eating—chewing, swallowing, and so forth—tend to eat less. Ergo, listening to music or watching TV during meals could lead to unintentional overeating, according to a press release. The Huffington Post UK reports researchers conducted three experiments to show the power of what they call the Crunch Effect. In one, for example, subjects listening to loud noises on headphones ate more pretzels (4) than subjects listening to quiet noises (2.75). Researchers believe that\\'s because the sound of eating may be a \"consumption monitoring cue\" for our bodies. Sound is an important part of eating, but its exact role hasn\\'t been studied much. \"For the most part, consumers and researchers have overlooked food sound as an important sensory cue in the eating experience,\" study coauthor Gina Mohr says in the press release. Medical Daily reports the study\\'s results reinforce those of a 2007 study that found people who are distracted while eating tend to eat more. \"If people are more focused on the sound the food makes, it could reduce consumption,\" BYU\\'s Ryan Elder says in the press release. But that doesn\\'t necessarily mean we should all be eating in silence. \"The key takeaway is to be hyperaware of all your food’s sensory properties,\" Medical Daily states. \"Your senses are the best tools for mindful eating.\" (Meanwhile, being tired may make you snack like a pot smoker.)\\n',\n",

But a case involving the phrase was dismissed Tuesday by a judge in Canada, who found it\\'s not always illegal to shout the phrase at female reporters, the CBC reports. Justin Penton, 28, yelled \\'f--- her in the p----\" at reporter Heather Gillis last year as she interviewed the mayor of St. John\\'s and he drove by them in his truck. Gillis took a picture of Penton\\'s license plate and ultimately criminal charges were filed against him. A provincial court judge in St. John\\'s found that while it could be illegal to shout the phrase at someone, in this case the circumstances did not merit a charge of disturbing the peace. \"Something more than emotional upset and a momentary interruption in a conversation is needed to constitute the criminal offense,\" he wrote in his decision. Rather, Penton would have needed to disturb the \"ordinary and customary\" proceedings of a public place in order for him to have committed a crime, the judge said. (On the day in question, the dump where Gillis was interviewing the mayor was closed.) Gillis could be heard calling the judge\\'s ruling \"ridiculous.\" The mayor she had been interviewing at the time of the incident called the judge\\'s decision \"disappointing.\" The judge himself noted that while not criminal, Penton\\'s outburst was \"vulgar and offensive,\" Metro News reports.\\n',\n",

He\\'s also the senior operations manager of campus dining at Princeton University, which is taking exception to that last part of his resume, reports the Times of Trenton. Princeton, which told DeZarn to choose between his job and his weed, put DeZarn on paid leave yesterday as the two sides try to come to what Princeton terms \"reasonable accommodations.\" DeZarn says he smokes at home, not on the job, and that he\\'d let Princeton know if he ever had an \"emergency situation.\" But as the AP notes, that raises a legal gray area: Under state law, Princeton doesn\\'t have to let DeZarn toke up for medical reasons while he\\'s on the job, or, as a university vice president puts it, work \"while under the influence of marijuana.\" But whether that control extends to his personal time is unclear. DeZarn, who\\'s loud and proud about his status as an advocate for legal pot, clearly hopes things go his way. \"It’s the best job I’ve ever had,\" he says. \"I hope somebody up the chain of command will look at what I’m requesting and have an open mind and some common sense.\" (Click to read about how couples who smoke pot together seem to have less trouble.)\\n',\n",

It added that he died in Switzerland after a short battle with cancer, though no other details were provided. Among the Bond films in which he starred were Live and Let Die and the Spy Who Loved Me, notes the BBC. Moore starred as Bond longer than any actor so far, a 12-year stretch from 1973 to 1985. The Guardian remembers him as \"the epitome of the suave English gent, quipping sweatlessly in a bespoke three-piece suit.\" (See some of those quips in this video.) Moore, however, had a long career beyond Bond, including roles in the hit TV shows The Saint and The Persuaders. He also was known for his humanitarian work, becoming a UNICEF goodwill ambassador in 1991. Moore received a knighthood for his charity work in 2003, thus becoming Sir Roger Moore. The Hollywood Reporter says Moore\\'s Bond was \"more of a charmer than a fighter,\" especially in contrast to the original Sean Connery take. And it seems Moore agreed with that: “My personality is entirely different than previous Bonds,\" he once said. \"I’m not that cold-blooded killer type.

The striking teachers were walking the picket line Thursday morning when they spotted smoke rising from a house about a block away, dropped their pickets signs, and ran to help. Science teacher Karen DeMarco tells WPXI that after there was no answer when they banged on a door, they knocked it down instead of waiting for firefighters to arrive. \"We found the lady of the house sitting in the one room, and there was several oxygen tanks there,\" DeMarco says. “We felt that we needed to get her out with the oxygen tanks. There was a daughter there and a grandfather there.\" \"Everybody got out,\" says music teacher Todd Hartman. Physical education teacher Jeff Modrovich and special education teacher Peter Keller also helped save the family from the fire, which ended up as a six-alarm blaze that destroyed the house, the Beaver County Times reports. \"If the teachers wouldn\\'t have been here, somebody wouldn\\'t have observed that, there\\'s a chance somebody could have been very seriously injured or even worse,\" says Ambridge Fire Chief Rob Gottschalk.

The solution, according to the report, includes embracing more communication with pathologists and radiologists, better harnessing of technology, and bringing back autopsies. There should also be more transparency and encouragement of disclosure, the report notes, so doctors won\\'t be hesitant to reveal errors because they\\'re afraid of malpractice suits, per CBS News. No one knows this better than Susan Sheridan, a patient-involvement advocate from Idaho whose 20-year-old son is permanently disabled because of a jaundice misdiagnosis when he was an infant, and whose husband died of cancer because of a diagnosis received too late. \"Our healthcare system … I have no clue who is in charge,\" she tells NBC. \"I assumed somebody was in charge of keeping us safe.\" The president of the National Academy of Medicine says in a release that this report \"is a serious wake-up call\" and that \"diagnostic errors are a significant contributor to patient harm that has received far too little attention until now.\" (A mistaken brain surgery, unnecessary chemo, and erroneous mastectomies all had devastating consequences.)\\n',\n",

However, they\\'re releasing few details, not specifying how many people are charged, their names, or what, if any, evidence exists.

As for his unexpected survival despite being shot three times: \"I used to be a very good Norwegian ski jumper,\" he said. Rushdie\\'s book first came out in 1988, and Iran\\'s supreme leader at the time considered it so blasphemous to Islam that he issued a fatwa on Rushdie that forced the author into hiding and remains in effect to this day.

Both Kellers weigh various questions that seem to come down to this: Is Bonchek Adams engaging in \"TMI\"?

A sample of the reactions: \"[Emma] Keller seems to be concerned about whether Adams\\'s decision to publicly discuss her diagnosis and treatment is \\'dignified,\\' both for Adams ... and for Emma Keller personally. You see, a particularly intense series of updates from Adams apparently ruined the Kellers\\' Christmas, because Emma couldn\\'t stop reading what Adams wrote, and that gives her complicated feelings,\" writes Abby Ohlheiser for The Wire. Ohlheiser refers to the Keller columns as \"tag-team concern trolling,\" and goes on to quote the relevant portion of Emma Keller\\'s piece: \"As her condition declined, her tweets amped up both in frequency and intensity. I couldn\\'t stop reading—I even set up a dedicated @adamslisa column in Tweetdeck—but I felt embarrassed at my voyeurism. Should there be boundaries in this kind of experience? Is there such a thing as TMI? Are her tweets a grim equivalent of deathbed selfies, one step further than funeral selfies?\" As for Bill Keller\\'s column, \"His point, like his wife\\'s, is underinformed and muddled in a mess of condescension toward Adams\\'s suffering and her work,\" writes Joe Coscarelli for Daily Intel. \"Instead of using their respective positions of power to wrestle awkwardly with something that makes them uncomfortable, the Kellers could attempt to consider Adams\\' online presence on its own terms, or just unsubscribe.\" There\\'s much, much more—but in a response to the uproar posted on the Times website yesterday, Bill Keller insists he\\'s also \"heard from readers who understood the point and found it worth grappling with.\"\\n',\n",

In the wake of Knowles\\' resignation, however, the church announced that it would abandon plans to boot the Occupiers.

New research in the Lancet finds patients who undergo morning heart surgery are twice as likely to suffer heart issues and other complications as patients who have surgery in the afternoon, per the BBC. It\\'s not that doctors are drowsy in the morning and therefore prone to mistakes. Rather, researchers say the body\\'s circadian rhythm regulates genes that are in top form and better able to handle stress in the afternoon, a fact that also explains why one\\'s risk of heart attack is highest in the morning. To discover this, researchers conducted several studies, one monitoring 596 patients who underwent an aortic valve replacement, half in the morning, half in the afternoon. After 17 months, they found 18% of morning patients had suffered a major adverse cardiac event, acute heart failure, cardiovascular death, or a heart attack during the operation, compared to 9% of afternoon patients. Morning patients also had twice the risk of other complications, per the study, which identified 287 genes linking the body clock to heart health, reports the Independent. A second study also found morning patients had significantly higher levels of troponin, a measure of heart damage, per the New York Times. This doesn\\'t mean morning surgeries should be avoided, but \"we should identify patients at high risk for complications—those with diabetes or other metabolic risks, for example—and operate on those in the afternoon,\" a study author tells the Times.\\n',\n",

But a new process out of Germany could offer a less expensive, easier way to create this cannabis component from scratch, with nary a marijuana leaf in sight: genetically engineering it from yeast, the New York Times reports. Biochemists at the Technical University of Dortmund say in a paper published in the Biotechnology Letters journal that by using the yeast, a consistent supply of THC for medicinal purposes could be generated without growing pot. \"This is something that could literally change the lives of millions of people,\" the CEO of a company that produces yeasts for THC and cannabidiol—another compound used for medicinal purposes—tells the Times. Japanese experimenters were among the first to eke out one of the necessary THC enzymes from yeast nearly a decade ago, and since then, less expensive and quicker DNA technology has helped scientists across the board find the rest of the genes needed to make THC. Right now only a small amount of THC can be generated from the yeasts, though scientists are working on boosting that production with some finagling of the gene-engineering process. And yeast does have one big competitor when it comes to producing THC: marijuana itself, with some varieties containing an ample 30% THC content by dry weight, the Times notes. \"Right now, we have a plant [that\\'s] essentially the Ferrari of the plant world when it comes to producing the chemical of interest,\" a professor who helped out with earlier gene-sequencing efforts tells the paper. \"Cannabis is hard to beat.\" (Hemp isn\\'t pot, by the way—and there\\'s just one gene that separates them.)\\n',\n",

       " '– With Republicans running out of ways to stop the looming Iran nuclear deal from becoming a reality, John Boehner is entertaining the idea of suing President Obama. The House speaker, who described the deal as \"worse than anything I could\\'ve ever imagined,\" said yesterday a lawsuit is \"an option that’s very possible,\" Politico reports. At issue is Republicans\\' complaint that Obama didn\\'t hand over every document relating to the deal for them to review, specifically leaving out agreements between the International Atomic Energy Agency and Iran, according to the Huffington Post. But, the Hill reports the administration claims it doesn\\'t even have those documents because the agency keeps them confidential. Regardless, the House passed a resolution yesterday stating Obama didn\\'t give it every necessary document related to the Iran deal, which would see the country scale back its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The House passed another resolution rejecting the deal today and has more votes scheduled for next week. However, these votes are all \"essentially symbolic,\" as the Iran deal has the support of 42 Democrats in the Senate, according to HuffPo. The Hill reports that leaves Republicans with no clear way to stop the Iran deal. But Boehner isn\\'t giving in yet. \"This debate is far from over,\" the House speaker said yesterday. \"It is just beginning.\"\\n',\n",

Specifically, a complex migraine known as a “migraine with aura,” whose symptoms can mimic stroke symptoms, her doctor tells the Los Angeles Times. But the CBS reporter, who viewed the now infamous clip of herself for the first time yesterday, says she’s now “fine, wonderful,” though her instant (and reluctant) celebrity has been “a bit overwhelming.” In her first interview since the incident, back on her own station, Branson says she got a headache while working and felt “nauseous and dizzy.” She was “frustrated and terrified” during the report: “I was like watching myself in a movie. I knew what I wanted to say, but I couldn’t say it.” Afterward, \"I felt like I was going to collapse. My right cheek went numb, then my right hand.\" But her doctor thinks it was an isolated incident, and she is looking forward to getting back to work and “reporting on the stories, not being the story,” she says. “This will all blow over.

The State Department says Kerry issued the ultimatum in a Wednesday telephone call to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Kerry\\'s spokesperson, John Kirby, says Kerry expressed grave concern over Russian and Syrian government attacks on hospitals, water supplies, and other civilian infrastructure in Aleppo. He says Kerry told Lavrov the US holds Russia responsible for the use of incendiary and bunker-buster bombs in an urban area. Kerry told Lavrov the US was preparing to \"suspend US-Russia bilateral engagement on Syria,\" including on a proposed counterterrorism partnership, \"unless Russia takes immediate steps to end the assault on Aleppo\" and restore a ceasefire. UN chief Ban Ki-moon says the situation in rebel-held parts of Aleppo is worse than a \"slaughterhouse\" and implicitly accuses Syria and Russia of committing war crimes, the AP reports. Without naming countries, Ban said Wednesday that \"those using ever more destructive weapons know exactly what they are doing—they know they are committing war crimes.\" The Syrian government announced the offensive to retake rebel-held eastern Aleppo, and the only countries carrying out airstrikes are Syria and Russia. Ban said \"hospitals, clinics, ambulances, and medical staff in Aleppo are under attack around the clock.\" \"International law is clear,\" he said. \"Medical workers, facilities and transport must be protected.

He was also booed after saying anybody in the US illegally should be deported, though the crowd at Aiken Technical College reacted more positively when he said he is against Planned Parenthood and does not believe human activity is contributing to climate change. Wilson, who voted against extending the Violence Against Women Act in 2013, also faced chants of \"You lie\" when he said he fully supported enforcement of laws against domestic violence, the Post and Courier reports.

Around half the 821,000 tons of steel needed for the project is expected to come from outside the US.

It beats by 10 million years the previous record-holder, a specimen from an insect relative called the springtail. “A 50-million-year-old worm sperm from Antarctica?” Benjamin Bomfleur of the Swedish Museum of Natural History marvels to the Washington Post of his team\\'s discovery. “Who would have thought that’s possible?” These types of cocoons aren\\'t of the butterfly variety but were instead used in the mating process, explains Popular Science.

As some moderates backed away from the plan, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said White House officials \"strenuously disagree\" with the \"not believable\" CBO report, which predicts that 24 million fewer Americans will have health insurance a decade from now if the House health care plan replaces the Affordable Care Act. A roundup of coverage: House Speaker Paul Ryan went for a glass-half-full approach and highlighted the report\\'s prediction of a smaller deficit, the Washington Post reports. The bill is about \"giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford,\" Ryan said. \"When people have more choices, costs go down.\" Top Republicans showed no sign of backing away from the bill after the report, though some GOP senators expressed deep misgivings, the Hill reports. Sen. Bill Cassidy called the CBO score \"awful,\" while others said they would wait for the House\\'s final version. Sen. Lindsey Graham said the chamber would work to improve the House product, not reject it. Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi held a joint press conference and called for the House bill to be dumped, the Guardian reports. \"In terms of insurance coverage it\\'s immoral, in terms of giving money to the rich at the expense of working families it is indecent and wrong,\" Pelosi said. House Republican Rob Wittman said he\\'s opposing the House bill because of the CBO report. \"It is clear that this bill is not consistent with the repeal and replace principles for which I stand,\" he said in a statement posted on Facebook. \"I do not think this bill will do what is necessary for the short and long-term best interests of Virginians and therefore, I must oppose it.\" The New York Times takes a look at the report\\'s findings and at who will be most affected by the House health bill. Those most likely to lose health insurance under the plan are low-income people without children who gained Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Tishay Wright, a former project administrator at Southland Construction Management, claims the gifts were retaliation from boss and co-owner Kenneth Hayden after Wright objected to him calling her and another female employee “my bitches,” Courthouse News reports. According to SF Gate, the suit says Hayden stopped Wright from picking a present at an anonymous company Christmas exchange and handed her a special wrapped gift. Inside she found a Confederate flag-decorated purse with photos inside of Hayden dressed as President Trump sitting before a Confederate flag and posters reading “The Southland Shall Rise Again” and “Make Southland Great Again.” “I couldn’t believe what I had received from my bosses,” Wright says. “It takes me back to slavery days. I am not a slave.” Wright claims she was fired in March after telling co-owner Anita Hayden that the gifts were inappropriate. The suit alleges further discriminatory workplace behavior by the Haydens, claiming that along with reducing her responsibilities after she complained about Kenneth’s language, the supervisors used racist rhetoric, including telling a Sikh intern to “go get your people before they blow something up\" and often joking that Mexican workers could be paid in beer. Southland Construction has yet to issue a statement regarding the complaint filed on Thursday. “I kept being told by my family to not be afraid to speak up,” says Wright, who hails from liberal Berkeley, where she “never encountered anything like this.”\\n',\n",

The number of militias, skinhead gangs, and other extremist groups in the US dropped last year for the first time since 1999, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The hate-group watchdog found that the number of extreme-right groups dropped around 14% to 2,035, though it says the fall followed \"four years of explosive growth,\" reports CNN. The number of organizations classed as hate groups dropped 7% to 939—up from just 457 in 1999. \"Patriot\" groups dropped by 19% to 1,096, but there were only 149 such groups in 2008. The drop is owed to many factors, including internal squabbles, legal troubles, the improving economy, widespread demoralization at President Obama\\'s re-election—and the adoption of some extremist policies by mainstream politicians, the SPLC says.

Though it\\'s not clear if this was the case with Vargas, the AP notes it\\'s common for the Border Patrol to release people on their own recognizances, with notices to appear in court later. With such notices, people can generally travel throughout the US without being detained again. Vargas, who revealed his undocumented status in a 2011 essay, was at the border with Mexico to support child migrants; after arriving, he learned that he was in a specially-patrolled area and may not be allowed out without documentation, Business Insider reports. \"I didn’t realize just how much a militarized zone the Texas border is,\" Vargas told the Dallas Morning News on Sunday. The journalist tweeted earlier today that he was \"about to go thru security at McAllen Airport. I don’t know what’s going to happen.\" A Huffington Post reporter then tweeted a photo of Vargas being handcuffed an hour later. Vargas came to the US at age 12, CNN notes. His only IDs for airport security, he tweeted, are his \"Philippine passport and my pocketbook US Constitution.\"\\n',\n",
       " '– Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday criticized Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin, accusing him of placing a \"time bomb\" under the state and sharply denouncing brutal repressions by the Bolshevik government. The harsh criticism of Lenin, who\\'s still revered by communists and many others in Russia, is unusual (though not unheard of) for Putin, who in the past carefully weighed his comments about the nation\\'s history to avoid alienating some voters. Putin\\'s assessment of Lenin\\'s role in Russian history during Monday\\'s meeting with pro-Kremlin activists in Stavropol follows on attacks last week on the anniversary of Lenin\\'s death, notes Newsweek. He denounced Lenin and his government for brutally executing Russia\\'s last czar along with his family and servants, killing thousands of priests, and placing a \"time bomb\" under the Russian state by drawing administrative borders along ethnic lines. As an example of Lenin\\'s destructive legacy, Putin pointed at Donbass, the industrial region in eastern Ukraine where a pro-Russia separatist rebellion flared up weeks after Russia\\'s March 2014 annexation of Ukraine\\'s Crimean Peninsula. He said that Lenin and his government whimsically drew borders between parts of the USSR, placing Donbass under Ukrainian jurisdiction in order to \"increase the percentage of proletariat\" in a move Putin called \"delirious.\" Putin also blasted the Bolsheviks for losing World War I in their quest for power. Putin\\'s recent criticism of Lenin could be part of his attempts to justify Moscow\\'s policy in the Ukrainian crisis, but it also may reflect the Kremlin\\'s concern about possible separatist sentiments in some Russian provinces. Despite his remarks, Putin signaled that the government has no intention of taking Lenin\\'s body out of his Red Square tomb, warning against \"any steps that would divide the society.\"\\n',\n",
       " '– A spokesman for the Bay Area contractor that built the Berkeley apartments where a balcony collapsed Tuesday, killing six, says the company has \"a very good reputation\" and has \"never had an incident like this before,\" but a series of recent lawsuits suggests otherwise, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Segue Construction paid out $3 million in 2014 in a settlement dealing with \"water penetration\" issues on balconies in a San Jose apartment complex, the paper notes—issues that Segue blamed on a subcontractor before settling. Segue spokesman Sam Singer tells the Chronicle the San Jose balconies were \"substantially different\" in design from the Berkeley balcony. But a second suit Segue settled in 2013 ended with a $3.5 million payout to the owners of a Millbrae condo complex, with a lawyer for the plaintiffs telling the paper \"water got into the structural wood framing for the balconies and dry-rotted out the wood members,\" as suspected in the Berkeley collapse. And Berkleyside.com has uncovered yet another lawsuit, still in litigation, accusing Segue of \"water intrusion causing tangible property damage\" in Colma, though balconies weren\\'t specifically mentioned. The website also details $11,000 in OSHA fines Segue has racked up since 2006 for work-site safety violations; Singer says the fines were \"pretty minimal\" considering how much work Segue has done over the years. But back in Berkeley, Singer tells the Chronicle building maintenance needs priority, and Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates says state balcony codes may need to be scrutinized. Meanwhile, hundreds attended a Mass and separate candlelight vigil for the victims last night, and pointing fingers wasn\\'t on the agenda. \"We may ... want to lash out and talk about the balcony and who built it,\" said Father Aidan McAleenan at the Oakland cathedral Mass, per the AP. \"But at the end of the day what [families] want the most is to see their loved ones.\"\\n',\n",

       " '– Scientists have made their own version of Jupiter\\'s Great Red Spot in a lab, and it suggests that the spot\\'s cause is very different from what\\'s been postulated. An existing theory holds that the spot is the result of chemicals underneath the planet\\'s clouds. But following the new research, experts say that the sun is responsible for the color: Sunlight may break up chemicals in Jupiter\\'s atmosphere, Phys.org reports. Scientists in Pasadena, Calif., came to the conclusion after re-creating the effects at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. They were able to get a Spot-like red effect by directing ultraviolet light at ammonia and acetylene, gases that are both found on the planet. Their new theory: \"Most of the Great Red Spot is actually pretty bland in color, beneath the upper cloud layer of reddish material,\" says a researcher. \"Under the reddish \\'sunburn\\' the clouds are probably whitish or grayish.\" So why is it confined to just one spot? \"The Great Red Spot … reaches much higher altitudes than clouds elsewhere on Jupiter,\" the expert notes. The Spot is actually a storm with winds of up to hundreds of miles per hour, the Daily Mail reports. Wind in the area brings ammonia particles higher in the atmosphere where they can be exposed to more sunlight, and a vortex keeps them there, the researchers say. The Spot, by the way, is a lot smaller than it used to be.\\n',\n",

A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll has found that 94% of blacks back President Obama, compared to zilch for Romney. The poll also found that Obama is doing better among Latinos, voters under 35, and women. Romney fares better with whites, rural voters, and seniors. Overall, the news isn't good for Romney as he's about to head to the GOP convention. A Romney-Paul Ryan ticket rates 4 points behind an Obama-Joe Biden ticket, the poll finds. Fears about the economy continue to create problems for the president, but voter concerns about Romney's tax returns and Medicare plans present even bigger obstacles for Mitt, notes NBC. Observers point out, however, that Obama isn't out of the woods until he passes the 50% mark in polling. “When a guy gets stuck at 48%, it doesn’t mean they are out in the clear,” says GOP pollster Republican pollster Bill McInturff. “It means they are in an incredibly competitive campaign.”\\n\",\n",

As a result, three-time world champ Cori Schumacher has collected more than 21,000 signatures on Change.org demanding that Roxy pull the \"all sex, no surf\" ad, reports the Los Angeles Times. It\\'s an example of the sexism rampant in the sport, Schumacher argues. \"Surfing should be a place where women can show they\\'re strong and powerful.

       " '– President Trump\\'s DACA decision—to end protection for young immigrants brought to the country illegally as kids and punt the issue back to Congress—is a hot topic on the nation\\'s editorial pages. Here\\'s a sampling: Wall Street Journal: The newspaper complains that Trump was \"at his worst\" when he went after Dreamers in the campaign but thinks that Obama was \"at his most cynical\" when he instituted DACA on iffy legal grounds. The editors see Obama\\'s action as a calculated political decision, one that \"teed up this moral crisis.\" Also at its \"worst\"? The GOP for making this issue a priority now. Regardless of all that, it\\'s now up to Congress to protect these young immigrants, and to do so without using them as political weapons. New York Times: Its editorial accuses Trump of \"cowardice\" for sending Jeff Sessions out to do the \"dirty work\" of announcing the move and suggests Trump doesn\\'t even understand the implications of the decision. \"DACA is morally right, legally sound and fiscally smart policy,\" the editors write. \"It was also the only humane choice Mr. Obama had in the face of Congress’s failure to pass any meaningful immigration reform in the last two decades.\" National Review: Trump made the right move because \"DACA is an extralegal amnesty at odds with our constitutional system,\" write the editors. They urge Republican lawmakers to use the next six months wisely to win border-security measures from Democrats (such as E-verify for all hires nationwide) in exchange for codifying DACA. Washington Post: The editors call the move \"heartless\" in terms of the Dreamers but says it could hurt the US economy, too. \"By subverting the employment and educational prospects of so many promising young people, Mr. Trump has sapped their earnings and purchasing power, withdrawn their college prospects and imperiled their jobs,\" they write. No wonder so many corporate execs are in opposition. \"Now, unless Congress acts, the United States will suffer along with the dreamers.\" Breitbart: It\\'s not an editorial, but a post at the site suggests that Trump blew it when he tweeted Tuesday night that he would \"revisit\" the issue if Congress failed to legalize DACA. Trump just gave away his leverage and ticked off supporters who would be happy to see DACA end, period. \"Trump’s base might be willing to accept a compromise on DACA at the end of six months, but not at the start,\" writes Joel Pollak. Los Angeles Times: \"Pure cruelty\" declares the editorial\\'s headline. \"What public good is achieved by yanking such people from their homes, families and communities and sending them to countries where they are strangers and often don’t even speak the language?\" The fix: Congress must resurrect the DREAM Act and give these youths a path to citizenship.\\n',\n",

But Fox News believes there\\'s a likelier candidate: NBC political reporter Katy Tur, who also released a new book, Unbelievable: My Front-Row Seat to the Craziest Campaign in American History, on Tuesday. To mark the occasion, Tur gave interviews on NBC\\'s Today and MSNBC\\'s Morning Joe, where it\\'s entirely possible the morning-show-loving Trump saw her. Tur spent 2016 traveling with the Trump campaign, and the president \"wasn\\'t her biggest fan,\" in the words of Fox News.

       " '– A military mom whose rare form of cancer was discovered when she gave birth to twins has died, after two months of battling the illness and attracting a devoted online following. Jenna Hinman, 26, succumbed on Monday to a placental cancer that doctors found when she gave birth to Azlynn and Kinleigh on March 3, ABC News reports. The girls were delivered 30 weeks\\' premature (at 3 pounds, 6 ounces, and 2 pounds 9 ounces, respectively) and stayed in intensive care for 6 weeks, but are fine today. For Jenna, the battle was far more severe. Doctors had to invent treatments because Hinman\\'s stage 3 choriocarcinoma—which originates in fast-growing placental tissue—is incredibly rare, the Post-Standard reports. Hinman was placed in a medically induced coma and given chemotherapy, but while her cancer count fell, she stayed in critical condition and eventually died of complications from pneumonia. \"She\\'s probably the most kind-hearted person I ever met,\" said her husband, Army Sgt. Brandon Hinman, back in March. \"She would go out of her way for anyone, give them the shirt off her back.\" The outpouring has been tremendous, as thousands sent messages and donated money: \"Many cried at Monday\\'s news that Jenna had died,\" wrote the Post-Standard in an editorial.

       " '– When Colman Chadam was born in 2000, he underwent extra medical tests after a congenital heart issue was discovered. Doctors learned that the infant carried genetic markers associated with cystic fibrosis, but he never went on to develop the disease. In fact, that test was the boy\\'s only interaction with it—until 2012, when he was kicked out of middle school. His parents had offered up the information when they enrolled him at a school in Palo Alto, Calif., and somehow teachers found out, reports Wired. Those teachers allegedly told parents of two kids with cystic fibrosis during a parent-teacher conference, and suddenly those parents were demanding Colman\\'s removal because their own kids would be more vulnerable to infection. (Per the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, people with CF are known to be able to spread \"certain germs among others with the disease.\") It all played out a bit like the medical version of thought crime—where potential (or in this case predisposition) is punished—but within a few weeks the school let Colman return, thanks to the family obtaining an injunctive relief; now the Chadams have relocated altogether. Still, their lawsuit accusing the district of violating both the Americans With Disabilities Act and privacy rights is still making its way through the courts, as they appealed to the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last month and got some support from the DoJ and Department of Education, per this amicus curiae brief. \"The family would like a definitive and unequivocal statement from the Ninth Circuit that you can\\'t just do this to people based on genetic markers alone,\" their attorney tells BuzzFeed. The implications could be broad, not only regarding how genetic information can be used, but who gets to make decisions based on the resulting \"real or imagined\" safety concerns, he adds. (Also, DNA testing can sometimes be too good.)\\n',\n",
       " '– There\\'s no denying that humans are mad for their cellphones, but some are clearly more attached than others—and scientists now have a clearer understanding of why. Generally speaking, people who constantly check their phones have a problem controlling impulses, period, and they\\'re not so great at delayed gratification, either, reports Bustle. Once a person of this nature checks their phone, it triggers the impulse to keep checking it again and again, even if the reward will be a paltry one, say psychologists Henry Wilmer and Jason Chein of Temple University in a post at Science Daily. They drew the conclusion after putting 91 undergrads through a series of tests that measured how often they checked their phones, how well they controlled their impulses, and whether they\\'d prefer to receive a small amount of money immediately or a larger sum if they waited a few days to a year. Among other things, Wilmer and Chein found that students who were least interested in waiting for that hypothetical sum of money—in other words, they were impatient—were more likely to check their phones frequently. \"Mobile technology habits, such as frequent checking, seem to be driven most strongly by uncontrolled impulses and not by the desire to pursue rewards,\" Wilmer concludes in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review. A post at Cosmopolitan draws a lesson from the research: \"If you\\'re the type to never let a retweet remain un-liked or a friend request go unnoticed, take a peek at some other areas of your life,\" writes Katherine Schreiber. \"If you\\'re having trouble reining in urges—to, say, eat the whole pint of ice cream, resist ordering one more round, or flip out at a coworker or friend—it may be time to take a break from your smartphone and start practicing some self-regulation.\" (Some people have \"ringxiety.\")\\n',\n",

He also suffered a head injury from a blunt object, according to the autopsy, which was conducted by Israeli doctors and attended by the chief Palestinian coroner, reports Reuters. “It was obvious through autopsy that there was black smoke on the breathing airways, windpipes and in the two lungs,” says a post on the Palestinian attorney general\\'s website. “This is proof of inhalation of this material during the torch, while he was alive.” The killing is widely presumed to be a revenge attack by far-right Jewish settlers for the murder of three Israeli teenagers who had been kidnapped, and the new finding could raise tensions even more. At Khdeir\\'s funeral in Jerusalem yesterday, Palestinians threw stones at Israeli police, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades. A police spokesperson says there have been \"no breakthroughs\" yet in Khdeir\\'s case. \"We\\'ll get to the bottom of it and catch those responsible,\" says a spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Police say the vehicle had been rented elsewhere (cops aren\\'t saying where) and then dropped off at the Albuquerque Avis center, per NBC News. The device was found by employees who had the car up on a lift to inspect it; they immediately called authorities upon their discovery. The device was eventually disarmed and the center\\'s operations went back to normal—but even though the situation ended with no one hurt, there were related issues to the investigation. The airport itself wasn\\'t shut down (the main terminal isn\\'t attached to the car rental center), but travelers who needed to rent from or return cars to Avis were forced to wait in a long line in a nearby parking lot while the situation was resolved, per the Albuquerque Journal. A woman who went to pick up a friend at the airport says she \"spent hours consoling\" Avis workers, who were reportedly told they had to stay put during the incident, KOB-TV reports. \"I can see the fear that they were having,\" she tells the station. \"Here you get a bomb threat and they keep them in there. [It\\'s] sad America has to have this fear.\" One of the center\\'s employees tells the Journal that \"we\\'ve had threats from hostile customers, but I\\'ve never heard of a bomb threat.\" (An alleged car bomber was injured because he likely didn\\'t set the timer correctly.)\\n',\n",

According to one memo, \"We pretty typically omit courtesy titles for \\'historic\\' figures who are dead—ie, we don\\'t say Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Hitler, Mr. Einstein.\" But, notes the Huffington Post, Elizabeth Taylor, Saddam Hussein, and Ronald Reagan did get the honorific after death.

Paul LePage said in the message to Rep. Drew Gattine on Thursday. He also demanded Gattine \"prove\" he\\'s a racist. The Portland Press Herald reports Gattine denies calling LePage a racist and says the voicemail was \"inappropriate and uncalled for.\" The issue arose after LePage said more than 90% of drug dealers in Maine are black or Hispanic earlier this week, according to CNN. LePage later invited reporters over and proceeded to long for an armed duel with Gattine. \"I wish it were 1825,\" he said, claiming he would point his gun \"right between his eyes.\" While the state\\'s Democratic Party chair calls that a \"threat,\" LePage claims otherwise. \"Obviously, it is illegal today,\" CNN quotes the governor as saying. \"It was simply a metaphor.\" LePage apologized for the voicemail but says he was justified in reacting that way after being called a racist.

But, no, it\\'s not about marijuana making kids smarter. In fact, kids who abstain from smoking of any kind do best of all. Chalk it up instead to the growing acceptance of pot. \"It’s an indication of the changing social norms,\" says the lead author of the study from the University of Toronto\\'s Dalla Lana School of Public Health. \"So it’s not an absolute that they do better; it’s that social norms have changed, and the population of people who use marijuana are more like the general population.” The study looked at data over the last 30 years and compared kids in grades 7, 9, and 11 in 1981 with their counterparts in 2011. As the U of T News puts it, \"it used to be that the kids out in the bushes smoking marijuana were the trouble makers,\" but the trend seems to have reversed itself. Now the kids smoking tobacco exclusively are the \"marginalized\" ones. The study found that 92% of students who smoke cigarettes also smoke pot, but only 25% of pot smokers also smoke tobacco. The biggest group was the 90% who reported smoking neither, and researchers say that\\'s the way to go. \"People dramatically underestimate the risks associated with cannabis use, particularly among youth,\" says the UT scientist.\\n',\n",

The culinary legend often opened up her home to friends. She even had a little black book full of recommendations for the best butchers and fishmongers, as well as careful instructions on how to use her erratic oven. The book, like everything else in the kitchen, is just as Child left it—except for the oven, which has been replaced with a new, state-of-the-art one.

Chinese aviation officials say the co-pilot, who remains unnamed, tried to shut off air recycling fans to prevent smoke from spreading to the passenger cabin on the Tuesday run from Hong Kong to Dalian, China, but flicked off the air conditioning by mistake. That lowered oxygen levels and set off altitude warnings, forcing pilots to descend immediately. Oxygen masks were also deployed during the emergency descent—photos of which later popped up on Chinese social media and can be seen at Australia\\'s News Network. (Or see this passenger video on YouTube.) After descending 19,600 feet in under nine minutes, pilots realized the mistake, re-activated air conditioning, and brought the flight to its regular altitude—but oxygen levels remained subpar for the rest of the flight, the BBC reports. Air China fired the whole flight deck crew and suggested the Civil Aviation Administration of China strip their licenses. For its part, the CAAC is investigating. On the upside, a passenger on flight CA106 says all 153 passengers appeared calm throughout: \"I didn\\'t think too much of it at the time—we didn\\'t know what was going on, nor did the flight attendants it seemed,\" Hoby Sun tells CNN. \"I\\'m not physically hurt, but the psychological impact lingers.

While the two girls bookending the photo strike acrobatic poses, the white girl in the middle stands next to the black girl with her elbow on the smaller girl\\'s head—making it appear, some say, like the child is an \"armrest.\" The Washington Post reports the promo is part of a larger GapKids campaign in collaboration with Ellen DeGeneres, meant to showcase \"girls can do anything,\" but the paper notes that in the campaign\\'s commercial, the black child is also on display with \"seeming passivity,\" sitting reticently while the other girls chat with DeGeneres. \"While all of the girls are adorable ... it becomes problematic when the black child is positioned to be a white child\\'s prop,\" Kirsten West Savali writes for the Root. There\\'s a bit of a twist to the story: The two girls in question are sisters, the daughters of Ray Donovan actress Brooke Smith, reports Co.Create. The white girl, Fanny, 12, is the biological daughter of Smith and husband Steve Lubensky, and the black girl is 9-year-old Lucy, adopted from Ethiopia by the couple in 2008, per People.

The Slants are an Asian-American band with a large Asian-American fan base, and “in the larger sense, minorities should have the right to label themselves,” says the band’s manager and bassist. “We deserve the right to protect our name.” The US Trademark Act says the feds can refuse a trademark if it \"consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter; or matter which may disparage\"; officials cited the section when denying the application, and pointed to uproars surrounding separate photos of Miley Cyrus and Spain’s basketball team with their eyes “slanted.” In an appeal that was rejected, the band got supporting statements from leaders in the Asian-American community. “This does not disparage Asian identity; it celebrates it,” noted one. The band is readying another appeal. The paper points out that both the Washington Redskins and rap group NWA have trademarks, while Jewish magazine Heeb was also denied.\\n',\n",

The grimace is \"a small way to dispense with unnecessary facades,\" Fessler writes. Other advantages of the grimace: It can accompany requests for favors—it\\'s a \"light-hearted way to acknowledge the burden being imposed,\" she notes—as well as offer a nonconfrontational way to say \"sorry not sorry,\" enabling one to be truthful \"with a dose of playfulness and self-deprecation.\" In the end, though, the emoji\\'s appeal may be much more meta. \"We are all the awkward, anxious, shameless grimace emoji,\" Fessler writes. \"It\\'s time we start admitting it.\" More effusing on the emoji here.

Gu Kailai did not contest charges that she poisoned former Bo family associate and British businessman Neil Heywood, and was convicted of his murder in a one-day trial earlier this month. A suspended death sentence in China is typically commuted to life in prison after two years, notes AP. Gu is expected to serve at least 14 years, reports the BBC. It's unclear what will happen to Bo, who was booted earlier this year as Communist Party secretary of the key city of Chongqing amid the biggest scandal to rock the Chinese leadership in decades; he hasn't been seen in public for several months. Most observers expected that Gu would dodge the death penalty because of her family's status, her record of mental illness, and her claim that Heywood threatened her son, reports the Wall Street Journal. Others speculated that authorities rejected a death sentence because they were concerned it would elicit sympathy for her. Gu argued that she was driven to murder because she suffered a metal breakdown over fear for her son's safety after a business battle with Heywood.

Researchers analyzed 730,000 IQ scores of Norwegian men entering the country\\'s military draft who were born between 1962 and 1991, per ScienceAlert. They found that IQ scores rose almost 0.3 points per year among men born between 1962 and 1975, then declined for men born after 1975. Overall there was a 7-point dip per generation, reports Newsweek. And the Norway study is no outlier: Other studies by European and Scandinavian researchers have noted a similar trend, notes CNN. The investigators believe the environment, rather than genetics, is responsible because they saw the same IQ drop within families, between brothers and sons. Parental education and family size did not seem to play a role in the decline. For most of the 20th century, IQ scores had been increasing, presumably because of better access to education. The researchers suggest the trend could be due to lifestyle factors, including changes in nutrition, how children are educated, media exposure, and how kids spend their free time. It\\'s also possible that IQ tests, which tend to emphasize formally taught critical thinking, simply haven\\'t been adapted to capture changes in the ways people think. As one psychology professor told CNN: \"We need to recognize that as time changes and people are exposed to different intellectual experiences, such as changes in the use of technology, for example, social media, the way intelligence is expressed also changes.

Two statues of nude male athletes were among 600 Greek archaeological treasures on loan to Qatar for an Olympic-themed exhibition, but Greece\\'s culture minister kicked up a fuss when he visited the Gulf nation and found the statues\\' private parts covered up, the Guardian reports. Officials in Qatar said the statues were covered up to avoid offending female visitors, but the culture minister said he \"couldn\\'t accept the antiquities not being exhibited in their natural state,\" a Greek official says. \"They were great works of art and aesthetically it was wrong.\" After the two sides failed to reach agreement, Qatar returned the offending statues to Greece.

Roof, who\\'s appealing his conviction and death sentence, says in the letter that his attorneys, Alexandra Yates and Sapna Mirchandani, \"are Jewish and Indian respectively. It is therefore quite literally impossible that they and I could have the same interests relating to my case,\" the Post and Courier reports. \"Because of my political views, which are arguably religious, it will be impossible for me to trust two attorneys that are my political and biological enemies,\" he continues. He also notes that his defense attorney at his federal trial was Jewish, and \"his ethnicity was a constant source of conflict even with my constant efforts to look past it.\" (In fact, the defense team alleged Roof threatened to kill the lawyer if he was ever freed.) Roof represented himself during the sentencing phase of his trial. Federal prosecutors say his 2015 rampage at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church was an attempt to start a race war.

A study published in Lancet has found that as many as 1 million children under age 15 are hit with TB each year, reports the Wall Street Journal. That\\'s double the previously established estimate, and some two-thirds of all cases go undiagnosed. The Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital and Harvard Medical School researchers were also able to for the first time put a number on the instances of what Reuters terms a \"drug-resistant \\'superbug\\' strain\" of TB: MDR-TB. As many as 32,000 kids across the globe become sick with that form each year. Reuters notes that researchers have historically focused more on TB in adults, for a duo of reasons: Adults are more likely to pass on the disease; and the diagnosis methods used on adults don\\'t always work on kids, in part because up to 30% of children who develop TB do so somewhere other than their lungs. But the attention is shifting to children in part because of what they can reveal about the transmission of the disease among adults: TB develops much more rapidly in children, signalling the presence of the disease in their adult family members or community. \"These 1 million children are missed opportunities for preventing TB every year,\" says the co-senior author of the study.\\n',\n",

There, they heard a seemingly moving eulogy, in which Panayiotou described his wife as \"a master baker who was so good, she could have made Mahatma Gandhi break a fast.\" It turns out the words had been carefully crafted by a man who had lost his wife—but that man wasn\\'t Chris Panayiotou. A quick Google search revealed entire sections of the eulogy were plucked from one Charles Atkins wrote about his late wife in 2010, then published online. His lawyers say an \"obviously distraught\" Panayiotou—whom Times Live reports had been spotted being \"very affectionate\" with another woman—used elements of the eulogy because he isn\\'t good with words, not because of any alleged connection to his wife\\'s murder, News24 reports.

But grad students don\\'t rely on their parents to pay for school as much as undergrads do, and their borrowing limits are often higher, leading to an ever-increasing cycle of owed money.

An upper jawbone belonging to a human relative who lived in what is now Tanzania almost 2 million years ago has been discovered with scratches on its still-intact teeth, and scientists have a clear idea about how they were made: by a stone tool held in the Homo habilis individual\\'s right hand. Why is that significant? Well, it represents the earliest known evidence of right-handedness among human relatives. The next oldest comes from the 500,000-year-old teeth of a Homo heidelbergensis individual, per National Geographic. Evidence also suggests Neanderthals were predominantly right-handed. In the case of Homo habilis, archaeologists think the teeth nicks came about thusly: The individual would have a piece of meat clenched in his teeth, and while he stretched it out with one hand, he used the other, dominant, hand, to cut it with a stone, explains Live Science. (It provides a graphic of what this looks like.) Occasionally, the stone would slip, and the direction of the resulting nicks suggests the right hand was the one used, a theory backed up in modern experiments. Few studies have analyzed Homo habilis teeth for such marks, but study author David Frayer of the University of Kansas hopes his research will encourage others to do just that. The discovery may also offer insights about when language first appeared since \"language, handedness, brain laterality ... are all interrelated,\" he tells Mashable.

Just as astounding is that Link has an identical twin brother Logan who remains in utero and is growing normally. The unusual situation, which has left Gorveatt both pre- and post-partum at the same time, is the result of twin to twin syndrome, in which the developing fetuses share a placenta and one draws blood from the other, leaving one \"bloated\" and the other \"weak,\" reports People. The syndrome is fatal 90% of the time, Martin Walker, their doctor and the director of fetal medicine at Evergreen Health Medical Center in Kirkland, Wash., tells ABC News. The twins underwent surgery at 21 weeks gestation in September to divide the placenta, but the pressure the twins put on Gorveatt\\'s cervix led to complications with Link\\'s amniotic sac; Walker was forced to deliver him on Sept. 29. Walker then manually closed her cervix to keep Logan in utero—which he would not have been able to do had he not previously divided the placenta.

       " '– On the heels of Minnesota putting a halt on accepting returns filed using TurboTax over fraud concerns, the tax-preparation software company has disabled all state tax return e-filings as of yesterday. The company acknowledged that it has identified \"an increase in suspicious filings,\" USA Today reports; the situations apparently involve stolen personal data (taken from someplace other than TurboTax\\'s internal systems) that was then used to file the returns. The Wall Street Journal reports that Utah, Alabama, and Georgia have issued press releases related to suspicions of fraud, with Alabama officials having spotted up to 16,000 worrisome returns. What Intuit CEO Brad Smith has to say, per a press release: \"We\\'ve identified specific patterns of behavior where fraud is more likely to occur. We\\'re working with the states to share that information and remedy the situation quickly.\" If you\\'ve already filed with TurboTax, do nothing, says the company: The AP reports that state tax returns already filed when the halt began yesterday will be transmitted as soon as the halt is lifted; federal returns can still currently be processed via the software. Intuit expects to start processing state returns again today with increased fraud protections, per a rep.\\n',\n",

A look around the landscape and the final poll numbers: The latest Washington Post/ABC News poll puts the candidates even at 48%, a number it says has \"barely fluctuated.\" The incumbent appears to have a slight advantage in terms of electoral votes, and Republicans are likely to keep the House as Democrats should hang onto the Senate. Click for the lengthy report. According to NBC/WSJ, the race is neck-and-neck with President Obama at 48% among likely voters to Mitt Romney\\'s 47%. That gives Obama a slight leg up from two weeks ago, when both candidates had 47%. Public Policy Polling gives Obama a 50% to 47% lead nationally, in what it says is the first time either candidate has opened up a lead of more than 2 points. In Iowa, the Des Moines Register gives Obama a 47% to 42% edge, though a scant majority trust him more with the economy. “If Romney can’t catch up here, he probably can’t catch up elsewhere,\" says a Dem pollster. \"Without Iowa and Ohio, Romney’s path to victory is incredibly narrow.” In Ohio, the Columbus Dispatch gives Obama a 50% to 48% lead, though that\\'s within the survey\\'s 2.2% margin of error, and the paper notes that strong GOP turnout could sway the Buckeye State for Romney. In Pennsylvania, the Pittsburgh Tribune puts the race in a dead heat at 47% all, with a 3.46% margin of error. Some 60% of those surveyed remain negative about the economy. Nate Silver, meanwhile, is giving Obama a better than 80% chance of an electoral vote win in case of a tie in the popular vote. Click for his polling breakdown.\\n',\n",

Republicans for the first time \"are uncertain as to whether resolute opposition to a Democratic idea is in their political interest,\" he writes in the Washington Post. \"Suddenly, it\\'s Democrats—and, in particular, the often conflict-averse Obama—who are relishing a fight.\" For them, it\\'s a win-win: Either they get a bipartisan bill or an election issue. In a similar vein, Gail Collins thinks the GOP is fumbling: The \"leadership originally seemed to believe that financial reform could be a replay of health care reform, with a political payoff for total obstruction,\" she writes in the New York Times. \"They’re discovering that the only real similarity is that both are almost impossible to explain. People love their doctors, but they tend to hate their bankers.

Daisy Coleman, who says she was raped in 2012 at age 14 by a 17-year-old boy who got her drunk at a party, tried to take her own life on Sunday, her mother tells the local station. \"She may never be OK,\" wrote Melinda Coleman on Facebook. She also implored Anonymous to take up her daughter\\'s case again. Prosecutors in tiny Maryville dropped charges against the 17-year-old boy, citing a lack of evidence, recounts the Daily News. When the Kansas City Star wrote about the case, it became national news, and Daisy did TV interviews about the allegations. She says her friend was raped by another boy at the same party. After the story came to light, Daisy and her family were subjected to harassment and bullying from others in the community, reports the Fox station.

The Bangor Daily News reports Mark Simon was visiting the park with his wife, who waited in the car in a nearby parking lot while he walked to a bluff to take photos. She got concerned when the sun went down and stopped a park ranger who was driving by, according to the Portland Press Herald. Her husband had been gone for more than two hours. The ranger found Simon's backpack at the top of a nearby cliff, WCSH reports. His body was 40 feet below at the water's edge. The tide carried Simon's body away from shore before rescuers could get to it, and the Coast Guard was called to pull it from the water. While Simon's death is believed to be accidental, the National Park Service is investigating and an autopsy is underway. Simon is the second person to die in Acadia National Park this year.

But that was before he found himself kicked out of a Chesney concert for precisely that reason. Of course, Blankenship happened to be imitating Chesney at the time, taking pictures with fans who mistook him for the country singer. He was then approached by a security guard who told him he was creating confusion and that \"higher ups\" wanted him tossed out of Nashville\\'s L-P Field. Despite Blankenship\\'s somewhat ill-advised prank, the concert promoter ended up apologizing to him and stating it had nothing to do with him being thrown out, WZTV reports.

The nonprofit Environmental Working Group tested 45 oat-based products like granolas and snack bars and found glyphosate in all but two, including organic products. Thirty-one exceeded 160 parts of glyphosate per billion, a level the EWG considers unsafe for children, per CNN, though the EPA\\'s standard is far lower, with its range topping out at 310 parts per million. \"Even at the highest level reported… an adult would have to eat 118 pounds of the food item every day for the rest of their life in order to reach the EPA\\'s limit,\" Monsanto tells CBS News. EWG President Ken Cook has a political response, saying this shows the EPA\\'s \"lawless\" nature under President Trump. Its standards \"pose real health risks to Americans–particularly children,\" he tells the Guardian, which hints at a larger issue, noting internal emails show the FDA has had a hard time finding food without traces of the nation\\'s most widely used herbicide, labeled a \"probable carcinogen\" by the World Health Organization. (Ice cream has it, too.) Cook says he\\'ll push the EPA to limit glyphosate use on food crops but companies \"relying on outdated safety standards\" should also \"step up.\" Quaker, Kellogg\\'s and General Mills each maintain their products are safe, with glyphosate levels below EPA limits.

Well, more specifically she says she married a large, ancient stone, she tells the Art Newspaper. \"It just means that at the moment I am not alone; somewhere on a hill facing the sea, there is a very beautiful ancient stone, and it’s not going anywhere. It will be there, waiting for me.\" But the 52-year-old, who has never married or had children and is still \"trying to crack the code myself,\" may be engaging in an act that is more than merely literal, as the Guardian reports in its rather forgiving comparison of Emin\\'s decision to Michelangelo\\'s \"vivid\" relationship with stone: \"In one of his letters [Michelangelo] claims that stones themselves cry out at political oppression. In his great unfinished sculptures of slaves, human forms struggle to emerge from raw stone like souls trying to be born from the chrysalis of carnality into the life of the spirit.\" Not getting it?

Researchers from the University of Houston, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Woman\\'s University followed 257 Latino adolescents—who were in the 85th percentile or greater for BMI—over a six-month period. During that time, about half the group snacked on peanuts or peanut butter right after school three to four times a week; their counterparts had the same snack less than once a week, and all children received nutrition education and engaged in physical activity. The researchers found the peanut-heavy group reduced their BMI more than twice as much as the other group over the course of the study. \"Obesity is the most pressing health issue facing us today,\" study co-author Craig Johnston says in a press release. \"We\\'d like to think it\\'s preventable, but from where I sit right now, there hasn\\'t been a lot shown to be very effective on a large scale.\" He says that snacking on peanuts offers a \"creative\" solution that can help people manage their weight, appetite, and hunger, and as Houston Public Media notes, peanuts are more universally liked than health foods like carrots. Meanwhile, Huffington Post reports that while just about any nut can make for a healthy, fat-filled snack (yes, peanuts are technically a legume...), almonds have the benefit of packing the fewest calories.

Gas prices are up 12 cents this week, and indeed shot up 3.5 cents overnight to a national average of $3.65, CNN reports. Geithner attributed that to improved growth expectations in the US, \"and also Iran is doing a little saber rattling.\" \"The best strategy for the country is to continue to make long-term investments\" to increase US oil production and encourage the use of more clean energy, Geithner said. But when asked about the strategic reserve he said, \"There\\'s a case for the use of the (reserve) in some circumstances, and we\\'ll continue to look at that.\" The remarks come after President Obama mocked the GOP\\'s consistent focus on expanding domestic drilling.\\n',\n",

North Korean state media published photos and a report Wednesday that show Kim Jong Un visiting a chemicals institute, and it was apparently more than a meet-and-greet. Yonhap reports that while there, Kim upped the production of rocket engines and warhead tips for ICBMs. The Wall Street Journal reports the timing of the visit to the Chemical Material Institute of the Academy of Defense Science wasn\\'t given, but the timing of the release is notable: It comes one day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a news briefing that he was \"pleased to see that the regime in Pyongyang has certainly demonstrated some level of restraint that we have not seen in the past.\" It has been 26 days since the country\\'s last missile launch. \"A two-week adherence of North Korea to UN prohibitions against missile tests hardly counts as a significant indicator of benign intent by the regime,\" is the assessment of one expert on the region to the Journal. CNN spotted something potentially more worrisome: The photos released by the Korean Central News Agency show diagrams that seem to depict two unknown and potentially in development missiles. One, the Pukguksong-3, seems to be a solid-fueled missile, as its predecessors were. This type has an advantage over liquid-fueled ones in that it doesn\\'t need to sit on a launchpad for a length of time—during which it would be exposed to a preemptive strike—to fuel. \"This is the North Koreans showing us, or at least portraying, that their solid-fuel missile program is improving at a steady rate,\" a researcher tells CNN.\\n',\n",

Unnamed sources say that the co-pilot of an Air India plane physically abused the pilot after an argument over paperwork last night—and that they then proceeded to take off like nothing had happened, the Times of India reports. Although an airline spokesman tells the Press Trust of India that \"there were only heated exchanges between the commander and co-pilot over some issue,\" both pilots have been grounded as an investigation into the matter is conducted, the Times notes. The scuffle on Flight AI 611, which was getting ready to depart Jaipur for New Delhi, apparently started when the captain asked the co-pilot to jot down some important preflight stats such as the number of passengers and takeoff weight, the Times reports. \"The co-pilot took offense at this and reportedly beat up the captain,\" an unnamed source tells the paper. After the alleged abuse, the pilot decided not to report the incident right away and fly on to Delhi anyway, \"in the larger interest of the airline,\" the source adds. Senior Air India officials tell the Times this co-pilot has been under the microscope before, including for goading another captain into a fight and for previous \"rude and unbecoming\" actions; the captain of Flight AI 611 reportedly doesn\\'t want to fly next to him again, either. USA Today and AFP note the airline has had its fair share of other troublesome incidents, including shoddy management, \"technical glitches,\" and staff being tardy for work.

But an arbitrator cleared the champ of charges he ingested a banned substance, conceding the drug got into his system exactly as Roberts says it did—through smooching with his girlfriend, reports Sports Illustrated. Roberts, 28, who won the 4x400-meter relay with Team USA at the 2016 Rio Games, was suspended in May after testing positive for probenecid. The runner says the drug got into his system through his girlfriend, who was treating a sinus infection and whom he \"frequently and passionately\" kissed. Roberts\\' paramour bought the drug during a trip to India and was still taking it when she returned to the US. \"He had no idea that kissing his girlfriend could lead to his ingesting a prohibited substance,\" the independent arbitrator writes in a June 20 report released Friday, per the BBC. \"When he kissed her he did not remember the taste of medicine in her mouth,\" he adds. The decision was expedited so Roberts could compete in the USA Track and Field Outdoor Championships in order to qualify for world championships in London next month. The arbitrator says the failed drug test for Roberts \"must have been like lightning out of a clear blue sky for him to learn by kissing his girlfriend this time that he was exposing himself to a prohibited substance,\" adding that the runner \"has met his burden of proof.\" The case echoes that of pole vault champ Shawn Barber, who tested positive for cocaine after visiting a female escort, USA Today notes.

Some two months before she was killed, Olsen, 35, posted photos on Instagram with hashtags, such as #Ihaveastalker, #creeperpic and #stalkeralert, that seem to indicate that she thought she was being stalked, the Telegraph reports. The photos, including an image of her walking her dog and another one of her shopping, appear to have been taken without Olsen\\'s knowledge. However, as the Guardian notes, it is not clear whether she was joking about photos taken by friends or if she was truly concerned. Olsen, originally of Summer Haven, Fla., was found by her boyfriend, an Italian artist. Concerned that she had not been answering his calls, he convinced her landlord to let him enter her locked apartment. After discovering her naked, bruised, and scratched body, he called police, per the Telegraph.

You might, like Matt Miller of the Washington Post, start asking things like, “Why doesn’t the president propose measures equal to the scale of our challenges?” or “Why can’t Republicans acknowledge demography or math?” Most of all you might wonder, “Why should we have to choose between timid half-measures and anti-tax fanaticism?” The answer: Because both parties are more concerned with winning elections than solving problems. On issue after issue “there’s a staggering void in the debate,” with issues and ideas neither party will touch. A third party could cover that ground; Miller’s even written a massive third-party stump speech, advocating tax hikes, cuts to popular programs, and other policies that won’t poll well, but that the “far center” should rally around. “Politicians will scramble to lead any parade that forms,” he writes. “Let’s get busy organizing the right parade, and together we might just save the country.\"\\n',\n",

The elder Markle, 74, says he\\'s tried to reach out to his 37-year-old daughter via texts and notes to no avail, and he tries to prove to the Mail that much of what\\'s been said about him have been \"grievous lies.\" The publication lays out those alleged fabrications one by one, as well as his rebuttals, including whispers that he faked a heart attack to avoid attending Meghan and Harry\\'s wedding (he shows hospital documents and his list of meds), that he betrayed Meghan by blabbing to the press about her (\"I\\'m not selling stories\"), and that the two were never close. To disprove that last bit, Markle produced for the Mail a trove of handwritten letters, photos, medical papers, and even an old plane ticket he says proves he attended her first wedding to Trevor Engelson (it was rumored he didn\\'t).

Santorum easily captures the top spot among Tea Party Republican voters (42% to 23%) and evangelical Republican voters (41% to 23%). One bright spot for Romney: 70% of his supporters believe the GOP would back him if he becomes the nominee; only 54% of Santorum's supporters feel the same. Gallup's poll, also released yesterday, found that 32% of Republican registered voters preferred Romney, and 30% favor Santorum. That's a 14-point jump for Santorum in recent days, and Gallup notes that his rise came at the expense of every candidate: He grabbed five points from Romney, six from Newt Gingrich, and three from Ron Paul. Side note: Paul's support hit a 2012 low: 8%. The New York Times/CBS poll out today shows that 30% of GOP primary voters support Santorum, to Romney's 27%.

The channel, called \"The Oscar Pistorius Trial—A Carte Blanche Channel\" launched last night with footage of the life of Reeva Steenkamp. The network behind the trial channel is one of three broadcasters that will be allowed to cover the trial live, though the testimony of Pistorius and other defense witnesses will not be shown and the judge has the option of halting coverage if it becomes intrusive, the AP reports. Pistorius faces life in prison if found guilty. He insists that he shot Steenkamp through a bathroom door after mistaking her for a burglar, and the trial is likely to hinge on ballistic evidence from his Pretoria home, the BBC reports. South Africa has no trial by jury, so Pistorius\\' fate will be decided by Judge Thokozile Masipa, the second black woman to become a judge in South Africa.

The video—Structural Discrimination: The Unequal Opportunity Race—uses a literal race as a metaphor and has been shown hundreds of thousands of times schools around the US for a decade. \"It was designed as a tool to throw light on American history,\" says the cofounder of the African American Policy Forum, which created the video. Others didn\\'t see it that way. “A lot of people thought it was offensive to white people and made them feel bad about being privileged,” Kenny Manning, a Glen Allen High School student, tells WRIC. The video was shown as part of a Black History Month presentation at Glen Allen. Presenter Ravi Perry tells the Post it got an \"overwhelmingly positive\" reaction at the time. Then the school started getting complaints. \"They are sitting there watching a video that is dividing them up from a racial standpoint. It\\'s a white guilt kind of video,\" Don Blake, the grandfather of a student, tells KSLA. The school district caved, banning the video. Manning tells WRIC the video wasn\\'t necessary anyway because there aren\\'t any \"racially motivated things\" happening at Glen Allen.

       " '– When hitting the road on a summer holiday, you\\'re bound to forget something. Hopefully it\\'s not your toddler. Police are questioning a French family after they apparently forgot their 3-year-old daughter at a rest stop while heading south to the French Riviera for a vacation. Travelers found the girl yesterday at a rest stop outside Loriol-sur-Drome, south of Valence, and waited for her family to return before calling police. The child could only tell officers that she had a brother and a sister and was \"going to the seaside\" when she saw \"daddy\\'s car pull away,\" per the Guardian. Police issued an alert and the parents only noticed their mistake when they heard it on the radio about 45 minutes after the girl was found. The child had apparently been left at the rest stop—which included a playground, per Sky News—around midday. \"None of them had noticed she wasn\\'t there\" in the vehicle, an officer says. The BBC reports the girl\\'s father called police at 3pm. By that point, the family had traveled 93 miles and were more than halfway to their destination. They turned around and were reunited with their daughter about two hours later at a police station. Police were questioning the girl\\'s parents last night to ensure the incident was just a case of forgetfulness. \"We are going to listen to what they have to say and talk to the prosecutor at Valence to see if this should be taken further,\" the officer says. They\\'re still likely to lose out on the Parents of the Year award thanks to this pair.\\n',\n",

They were taken Tuesday from Strängnäs Cathedral, in the town of the same name near Stockholm. Police say two crowns made of gold, pearls, and jewels and an orb that were part of the 17th-century funeral regalia of Sweden\\'s Charles IX and Kristina the Elder were lifted around noon, with witnesses describing two men fleeing and then taking off in a speedboat on Lake Malaren. The Guardian reports that\\'s the country\\'s third largest lake and sits \"a couple hundred meters\" from the cathedral. \"It\\'s simply not possible to sell these kind of items. So you can only wonder what their intentions are, and how much they know about these crowns,\" a rep with the Swedish Police National Operations Department says, per the Local. Agnevik echoes that: \"What usually happens with this type of object is that they are recovered sooner or later, because there are very few people who are prepared to handle such items. We have high hopes of getting them back.\" King Charles IX died in 1611; his wife died in 1625. The two are buried in the cathedral, per Deutsche Welle, and Quartz adds that they were interred wearing the crowns, which were later exhumed and displayed in the glass cases broken by the thieves. (An arrest was made earlier this year in England\\'s biggest burglary ever.)\\n',\n",
       " '– Many scientists have argued that several different species of human ancestors spread from Africa—but a 1.8 million-year-old skull and the fossilized remains of four other creatures seem to tell a different story. The scientists who found the bones at Dmanisi, in the country of Georgia, in 2005 say they show that a single species fanned out from the continent, the Wall Street Journal reports. \"There are these jaw-dropping moments in the life of a scientist,\" says a neurobiologist who examined \"Skull #5,\" as it\\'s called. \"Preconceived ideas ... start falling to pieces.\" The crux of the finding: Scientists have for years debated whether humans evolved from only one or two species (think tree branches out from a trunk) or many off-shoots that dead-ended (think a bush). This find bolsters the tree theory. The bones found in Georgia show a great deal of variation, but the pre-humans are believed to have died in the same place, within a few centuries of each other. So the researchers believe they are members of the same species, and reason that it\\'s likely the various skulls found in different places and times in Africa may not be different species, but variations of one species. Even aside from the tale it tells, the skull is a pretty impressive discovery. \"It\\'s got to be one of the most complete skulls ever discovered in the fossil record of human evolution,\" an anatomy professor tells NPR. And as the oldest batch of pre-human fossils found outside Africa, the bones set the date of departure from Africa \"much earlier\" than previously believed, David Lordkipanidze, the lead author of the study published in Science, tells the AP. (Previously, that movement was thought to have happened 1 million years ago.) With the Dmanisi finds, \"For the first time, we can see a population.

Boeckmann, under investigation since last year amid accusations that he exchanged leniency for sexual favors, stepped down on Monday after the state\\'s Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission informed him that it was in the process of recovering up to 4,500 images from his computers showing \"young men, many naked who are in various poses inside the judge\\'s home and outside in his yard,\" NBC News reports. \"There are numerous photos of naked young men bending over after an apparent paddling,\" says the letter, which warns Boeckmann not to dispose of the paddle.

Commission chief David Sachar says 12 victims have been named but there could be up to 100 from the last 30 years, ArkansasOnline reports. Boeckmann, a part-time judge in Cross County, is \"a criminal predator who used his judicial power to feed his corrupt desires,\" Sachar tells the AP. \"Every minute he served as a judge was an insult to the Arkansas Judiciary.\" In his resignation letter, Boeckmann, who is still being investigated by state and federal authorities, promised to never seek public office again.\\n',\n",

Getting off Klonopin was not pleasant: \"Nobody I know who are prescribed these medications is told, \\'By the way, when you try and get off this, it\\'s going to be like the most hellacious acid trip you\\'ve ever had where you\\'re f---ing clutching the walls and the hair is blowing off your head and you can’t believe you found yourself in this situation,\\'\" she said. \"Now the literal smell of the inside of pill bottles makes me want to throw up.\" (Dunham\\'s before/after photos have a message.)\\n',\n",
       " '– Brian O\\'Callaghan and his wife, Jennfer, badly wanted a second child. Working with Catholic Charities, in October they adopted a South Korean toddler with special needs, whom they named Madoc Hyeonsu O\\'Callaghan, according to this obituary. On February 3, the 3-year-old died, with injuries police say were consistent with being beaten, the Washington Post reports. O\\'Callaghan, a former Marine who served in Kosovo and Iraq and works at the NSA, has been charged with his murder, and prosecutors have an awful story: They say he beat his son on January 31 or the next day, didn\\'t help him for hours as he cleaned up bodily fluids around the home, and eventually took him to the hospital on February 1. This is \"an absolutely horrific crime on an absolutely innocent young victim,\" says a State\\'s attorney. \"Basically this child was beaten to death from head to toe.\" O\\'Callaghan, who appeared in court yesterday, says the boy slipped in the shower and hit his shoulder on January 31, while his wife was out of town, and that the next day everything seemed fine until the toddler went down for a nap in the afternoon and O\\'Callaghan noticed pink stains on the bedding and mucus coming from his son\\'s nose. An hour later, he says, the boy was unresponsive and his condition had worsened (the AP reports that the toddler was vomiting); he washed him off in the bathtub before taking him to the hospital. A detective says O\\'Callaghan had no explanation for the injuries shown on the boy\\'s autopsy—including a skull fracture, brain swelling, bruising on the forehead, and \"blunt impact to the back from a linear and triangular shaped object.\" But O\\'Callaghan\\'s attorney says a CT scan contradicted the autopsy, showing no skull fractures. He adds that his client \"has the unwavering support of his family.\" Says O\\'Callaghan\\'s grandfather, \"I find it impossible to believe, because he’s worked so hard to get this baby. He was so loving with him.\"\\n',\n",

That call has prompted a missing baby case in Beloit, Wis., that now has 40 federal, state, and local investigators racing against the clock. Police have ruled out a custody dispute, the AP reports, and the baby\\'s father, Bruce Powell, was also home when Marshall sounded the alarm, just three hours after she last checked on the baby when visitors left the home around 1:30am. WIFR reports there was no sign of forced entry, and interviews with those visitors turned up no suspects, though one woman who was returning to her home in Colorado pulled off the highway in Iowa when she got a call from police and was detained for an unrelated outstanding warrant. \"We have mobilized all the resources and are working with the City of Beloit, Sheriff\\'s Department, Division of Criminal Investigations from the state, and the FBI,\" Beloit\\'s police chief told the Beloit Daily News yesterday. \"We are scrambling because time is of the essence.

The bad: The 2012 season of the Women\\'s Professional Soccer League has been canceled. At issue is a legal battle with a controversial owner of one of the teams. Dan Borislow, who made a fortune with his magicJack Internet phone system, was bounced from the league at the end of last season. He\\'s fighting that decision in court, and WPS officials are suspending this year\\'s season to \"address the legal issues head-on before moving forward with competition,\" according to a statement. News of the season shutdown followed shortly a 4-0 Olympic-qualifying victory over Canada by the US women\\'s national team. WPS players Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan played a key role in the win, each scoring two goals. Complicating the ongoing league battle are different positions on Borislow. He made trouble over everything from team uniforms to stadium advertisements to location (he moved the Washington Freedom to Florida), and a union bullying grievance was filed against him, reports the Guardian. But Wambach supports Borislow. \"He\\'s got some ideas up his sleeve and if you know me, I\\'m always going to back that guy,\" says Wambach, who plugs magicJack on Borislow\\'s website.\\n',\n",

This according to a juror in the trial who spoke with Fox News on Wednesday. \"It was one person who kept the verdict from being guilty on all 18 counts,\" Paula Duncan said of the jury\\'s four days of deliberation, during which she said \"there were some tears.\" The 52-year-old, described by Fox as an ardent Trump supporter, said the holdout maintained she had reasonable doubt. Duncan explained her own thinking, saying the four boxes\\' worth of exhibits put forth as evidence by Robert Mueller\\'s team were compelling, and that \"certainly Mr. Manafort got caught breaking the law, but he wouldn\\'t have gotten caught if they weren’t after President Trump.\" She used the phrase \"witch hunt\" in her comments. One other tidbit getting pickup is her observation of what seemed to be the prosecution\\'s \"disinterest\" in the proceedings. \"A lot of times they looked bored, and other times they catnapped—at least two of them did. They seemed very relaxed, feet up on the table bars and they showed a little bit of almost disinterest to me, at times.\" A mistrial was called on the 10 charges the jury deadlocked over, and as Vox points out, it\\'s far from case closed for Trump\\'s former campaign chair: Prosecutors need to decide whether they\\'ll retry Manafort on those 10 counts (NPR reports they have to tell the judge of their intentions by Wednesday), he awaits sentencing for the eight counts he was found guilty of (he faces a maximum of 80 years), and he goes on trial in Washington, DC, on Sept. 17 for additional charges.\\n',\n",

According to CBS Los Angeles, Carmen Perez had just put baby Chloe into her stroller when a man started hustling toward them. \"He went just straight to me like he wants to get the baby or something,\" Perez says. \"I thought he was going to take it or do something to us.” She ran screaming toward a nearby business, but authorities say the man—later identified as 35-year-old Edgar Valdez—caught up with her and tried to take the stroller. Perez refused to let go of the stroller, even after being pushed to the ground, and Valdez ran off. A number of bystanders followed Valdez behind a building, where he was allegedly changing clothes to fool police. A security guard at a nearby marijuana shop handcuffed Valdez until officers arrived. “We can’t have men like this going around taking people’s kids,\" the security guard tells CBS. Valdez was arrested, and Perez and Chloe were taken to the hospital with bruises and cuts.\\n',\n",

It was one of the day\\'s two auspicious signings; earlier, interim Ukrainian President Arseniy Yatsenyuk signed on to what Reuters refers to as a \"landmark\" political association agreement with the European Union. It was ousted president Viktor Yanukovich\\'s opposition to the pact—in favor of closer ties to Russia—that started the protests that began the crisis. The deal calls for greater political and economic cooperation, and eventually free trade once a new president is elected in May. Yatsenyuk said the deal indicated that the EU would \"speak in one single and strong voice\" to support the Ukraine, CNN reports. As for that other signing? \"Frankly, I don\\'t care about Russia signing\" the annexation bill, Yatsenyuk said. \"I care about Ukraine, Ukrainians, and our European future.\" In other Ukraine news: Ukraine set today as the deadline for the militias patrolling Independence Square in Kiev to turn in the illegal weapons that they openly carry, the New York Times reports. Europe is insisting the groups disarm before any financial aid flows to Ukraine. Ukrainian troops will today join NATO training exercises in Bulgaria, the AP reports. The exercises were planned before the crisis broke, but take on an extra significance now. Vladimir Putin laughed off US sanctions, RT reports. Referring to the targeted lawmakers he derisively said, \"Yes, these are those so-called \\'polite people in camouflage with guns.\\' ... I need to avoid these citizens as they are \\'compromising the country.\\'\" He also said that he\\'d open an account at the sanctioned Rossiya bank. But Russia won\\'t issue retaliatory sanctions, he said, and it will keep repairing NATO helicopters in Afghanistan. Apparently retaliatory visa bans are another matter.\\n',\n",

Lisa Beaulieu tells Fox 61 a storm hit as she was heading home with her kids, but she didn\\'t think \"it would get that bad.\" It did. Suffield Police Chief Richard Brown says a tree fell on a support wire and brought a telephone pole crashing down while Beaulieu was driving by, the Hartford Courant reports. Beaulieu didn\\'t have a chance to avoid it and drove over an electrical wire that somehow became tangled under her car, which hoisted itself off the ground until it was dangling perpendicular with the road. “I was panicking,\" Beaulieu tells Fox. She called 911, and the operator stayed on the line with her until help arrived, NBC Connecticut reports. \"I prayed the entire time we were in the car,\" Beaulieu says. \"I prayed please don\\'t let lightning hit us, please don\\'t let the car shift.\" Emergency crews were able to get Beaulieu and her children out safely after about 45 minutes trapped in the car. Beaulieu thanks everyone who helped make her and her children \"feel so calm and safe.\" The storm that hit the Suffield area Wednesday resulted in a wave of emergency calls for flooding, house fires, and more.

Dashboard camera video shows Pete Vasquez being pulled over on the way to the auto dealership where he works as a mechanic by 23-year-old officer Nathaniel Robinson, the Guardian reports. Vasquez, who was stopped for driving with an expired inspection sticker, points to the dealer tags that made the vehicle exempt but is arrested by the officer after he pulls away when Robinson grabs his arm. The officer can be seen holding the Taser and shouting, \"Put your hands behind your back\" after Vasquez falls out of sight. \"He just acted like a pit bull, and that was it,\" Vasquez tells the Victoria Advocate, which notes Vasquez was arrested for the expired sticker but was ultimately released from the hospital without a citation. \"For a while, I thought he was going to pull his gun and shoot me.\" Robinson, who has been with the force since 2012, has been placed on administrative duty, and the local police chief says he is investigating the incident. A co-worker who witnessed the arrest describes Vasquez as a \"nice, sweet, gentle man\" and says he thinks the officer should lose his job. \"I told the officer, \\'What in the hell are you doing?\\' This gentleman is 76 years old,\" the co-worker says. \"The cop told me to stand back, but I didn\\'t shut up. I told him he was a godd---ed Nazi stormtrooper.\" The Advocate reports that the dealer tags did indeed make the vehicle exempt; had they not, such an offense is considered a Class C misdemeanor, and typically does not involve arrest.\\n',\n",

A new wave of seed varieties were deposited that hail from more than 100 countries and represent a \"sort of winter Olympics of crop diversity,\" per the director of the trust that maintains the facility. Among them: varieties of Japanese barley that will ensure the world won\\'t lose its access to miso should disaster strike, reports the Independent. Samples of that key miso ingredient, along with Brazil\\'s \"common bean,\" a rare Tennessean red okra, and nearly 200 types of wild potato have been added to the 820,619 samples that have been placed in the vault since it opened in 2008. It was constructed to hold up to 4.5 million seed samples, and sees one to two new deliveries each year, notes the Guardian. The Doomsday Vault, more formally known as the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, functions as a sort of backup, holding duplicates of seed samples otherwise housed in gene banks around the world. But this location is about as secure as possible: It sits within a mountain on a remote island in the Svalbard archipelago, between Norway and the North Pole, behind four sets of air-locked doors. It can weather nuclear war, an asteroid strike, and climate change. That hardiness likely influenced Japan\\'s decision to send seeds for the first time. The BBC reports that the 2011 earthquake and tsunami convinced the Barley Germplasm Center at Okayama University to pony up 575 samples after realizing its own storehouse wasn\\'t impenetrable.\\n',\n",
       " '– A network of escape tunnels with entrances concealed under bathtubs helped the world\\'s most powerful drug lord evade capture before his arrest over the weekend, investigators say. Early last week, Joaquin Guzman is believed to have escaped just minutes ahead of Mexican authorities, using a network of tunnels under the streets of Culiacan, headquarters of his Sinaloa cartel. US officials had traced Guzman to his hideout using a number on a phone seized in a raid earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reports. Guzman\\'s escape was short-lived: Using the same number, authorities were able to track him to the resort city of Mazatlan, where he was finally arrested after 13 years on the run. The arrest of a senior aide the day after Guzman\\'s narrow escape also provided key clues, and a wiretap being monitored by Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided the final breakthrough, the AP finds. A senior US official tells Reuters that another key break in the case came last fall, when a phone belonging to the son of Guzman\\'s deputy was seized at the US-Mexico border. \"We handled this case like we handled many: using technology to work up the chain, person by person, to the top,\" he says. Guzman is now being held in an underground cell while Mexico and the US work out who gets to prosecute him.\\n',\n",

Maybe not: A new study found that \"moderate\" runners lived longer than people who don\\'t exercise at all—and people who run lots of miles, HealthDay reports. The study, led by the co-director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute at the Lehigh Valley Health Network, involved 3,800 runners who supplied info on their heart risk factors and their use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen; almost 70% of the group clocked more than 20 miles a week. The findings were presented Sunday, but have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. According to the results, how much should you run? One cardiologist who reviewed the data suggests you do so no more than 2.5 hours per week, spread out between two or three sessions consisting of slow or moderately-paced running. It\\'s not clear why too much running might be bad for longevity, but the study appears to rule out factors like prior cardiac risk (linked to things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, family history, and smoking) or excessive use of NSAIDs (which have been linked to heart problems). One doctor who\\'s also a running coach tells NBC San Diego that extreme exercise can actually \"cause some scarring of the heart.\" And another recent study found that male marathon runners had more plaque in their coronary arteries—which can lead to a heart attack—than non-runners, Pioneer Press reports. Again, it\\'s not clear why, but one researcher notes, \"It is plausible, not proof by any stretch, that metabolic changes when running could be moderately toxic to arteries.\" (Another way to live longer: eat nuts?)\\n',\n",

Using data from 53,000 men in the UK, they\\'ve come up with a DNA-based algorithm that could someday predict whether one is likely to go bald—one that\\'s more reliable than family history. More to the point for those worried about it is the second half of this sentence: \"The results of this study might help identify those at greatest risk of hair loss, and also potential genetic targets for intervention,\" says a study co-author, per NBC News. In the study, the largest such one of male-pattern baldness to date, University of Edinburgh researchers identified 287 genetic markers linked to hair loss, per a release. That\\'s quite a step up, given that only eight such markers had been previously identified, reports Live Science. \"We are still a long way from making an accurate prediction for an individual\\'s hair-loss pattern,\" says co-author Riccardo Marioni. \"However, these results take us one step closer\" and \"pave the way for an improved understanding of the genetic causes.\" For now, researchers say their algorithm can be applied only to groups of people, but they hope to fine-tune it, perhaps by factoring in ages at the onset of baldness in future studies. Another of the researchers points to a notable factor: \"It was interesting to find that many of the genetics signals for male pattern baldness came from the X chromosome, which men inherit from their mothers.\" That suggests the maternal side is more to blame than previously thought, notes Seeker.

More than 10,000 people in Madrid\\'s Las Ventas bullring watched in horror Sunday as a bull started tossing Daniel Garcia Navarrete around \"like a rag doll,\" as one witness described the bloody scene to Reuters. The Sun has graphic images of the incident, both during and after the goring, which led to Navarrete being impaled about 6 inches into his throat by the 1,000-pound-plus animal; he reportedly sustained injuries to his tongue and the roof of his mouth.

Police then got a search warrant for another home owned by Warn, where his sons lived, and requested SWAT accompaniment when they went to search it Friday, News 5 Cleveland reports. No one let them in, and after they breached the door, one of the brothers engaged the SWAT team with rifle fire. After a 12-hour standoff, Mark Warn, 29, and Michael Warn, 31, were found dead inside. \"The entire sequence [of events] is bizarre, from beginning to end,\" says the police chief. Police haven\\'t established a motive, but Cleveland.com reports in 2015, the brothers went to their father\\'s home—where they\\'d been told they weren\\'t welcome—and Michael Warn threatened his father over money. Per a police report, the son said on a voicemail that \"people do crazy things when they do not get enough sleep\" and that \"if Richard does not give Michael money, Jehovah will be upset and might start burning s---.\" No charges were filed; the AP reports the sons had no criminal history. Police say there\\'d been \"friction\" between father and sons since 2004 and \"there was talk\" the brothers suffered from mental illnesses, but police haven\\'t verified that, per Cleveland.com. In 2004, Dr. Warn asked police for help, reporting that he struggled to discipline his then-teenage children (he has a third child, a daughter) after divorcing their mother and starting a relationship with another woman.

Among other things, it would explain why the characters never age and why the plots since then have gotten crazier and crazier: because all the action is taking place inside Homer\\'s mind, \"with no real world restrictions.\" Even though executive producer Al Jean told TMZ that it\\'s \"intriguing\" but not true, the theory keeps getting recirculated and, if nothing else, praised for its detailed research.

It involves an exchange between a son of Osama bin Laden and the US government over the al-Qaeda leader\\'s death certificate. Abdullah bin Laden asked for the certificate in the aftermath of the raid that killed his father, but a general counsel at the American embassy in Riyadh informed him that he was out of luck. Glen Keiser wrote that no death certificate existed, as is \"consistent with regular practice for individuals killed in the course of military operations.\" But he suggested an alternative: Noting that the US had closed the criminal case against bin Laden because he was dead, Keiser wrote that Abdullah bin Laden could request the order making that closure official, something called an order of \"nolle prosequi\" (\"we shall no longer prosecute\"). That would be the closest thing to proof of death. He even provided the necessary request form, adding, \"I hope that these U.S. Government documents are of assistance to your and your family.\" It\\'s not clear whether bin Laden\\'s son followed through on the suggestion.\\n',\n",

Not that there’s anything wrong with that, writes AJ Daulerio on Deadspin: In both New York and New Jersey, where the romancing allegedly occurred, it’s perfectly legal for a 24-year-old man to date a 17-year-old girl. The girl in question, whom Daulerio refers to only as EK, reached out to Deadspin with her story before changing her mind and deciding she didn’t want the infamy that would come along with its publication—but that didn’t stop Deadspin from running it. EK claims she met Sanchez while partying at a Manhattan nightclub on Dec. 31, and that she was upfront with him about her age. Sanchez texted her and she freaked out about it on Facebook (Deadspin has a screenshot; click to see), then he gave her tickets to the Bills-Jets game. Ultimately, they had a dinner date in New York and then they, in Daulerio’s words, “hooked up.” EK says they “went back to his place in Jersey after dinner,” and as proof, she offers pictures of what she claims is Sanchez’s room. After that, a few more 2am text messages followed, and, at least until recently, EK said she was still “close” with Sanchez, although she doesn’t think he’s “necessarily good to women.” (This is hardly the only recent juicy Jets story; click for more of the team's tabloid-worthy incidents.)\\n\",\n",

He had a sheepish look,\" social worker Elizabeth Griffin-Hall told 20/20. \"He just shrugged his shoulders and slammed the door.\" Once inside, Powell attacked the boys with an ax and torched 10 gallons of gasoline he had purchased to blow up his Washington state home, say authorities. In other disturbing developments in the case, officials have revealed that images of animated characters engaging in incest were discovered on Powell\\'s computer, reports AP. Powell lost a custody appeal shortly before the double murder-suicide and had been ordered to undergo a psychosexual evaluation because information about the images had been given to Washington authorities by police in Utah, where the family used to live.

The director of the schlocky film trailer that sparked rioting across the Middle East was 65-year-old Alan Roberts, the maker of softcore porn flicks like The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood, Gawker reports. Cast members and crew confirm that producer \"Sam Bacile\"—actually Nakoula Basseley Nakoula—hired Roberts, who apparently had no idea he was directing a piece of anti-Islamic propaganda. \"They redubbed it, they brought in the actors, put in new sounds, changed the names,\" says a colleague. \"And this was done later, before it was initially released. Of course Alan had nothing to do with it.\" No comment from Roberts, however, who has \"turned off his phone\" and is lying low since the riots broke out, the colleague says.

Per the CBC, a 21-year-old Italian woman got to a hospital ASAP, and now doctors are puzzling over her \"most unusual\" case of bleeding from her face and palms, a condition she\\'d apparently suffered from for three years. While the case study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal doesn\\'t reveal much detail about the woman herself, it notes she was diagnosed with hematohidrosis, a rare condition in which blood is excreted or sweated out through pores or unbroken skin (ie, it\\'s not coming out through a cut or other injury). The patient tends to break out in the bloody sweating when she\\'s either asleep or doing something physical, and the condition seems to get worse when she\\'s stressed. An episode can last up to five minutes. Per CTV News, doctors say the woman\\'s condition is embarrassing enough to her that she became \"socially isolated\" and showed depression and panic disorder symptoms. Although it\\'s still not known what spurs such bleeding, different theories have emerged, including blood coagulation disorders or an overactive nervous system that reacts when a patient is under stress. A Toronto hematologist thinks this particular patient has \"a very bizarre anatomical defect on a microscopic level\" that\\'s causing her bleeding, perhaps in her sweat ducts. A medical historian tells the CBC she was at first wary anyone could actually sweat blood, but after research reaching back to Aristotle\\'s time (and her find of nearly 20 cases since 2000), she now believes the condition exists. The patient has since been administered a heart and blood pressure med that has cut down—though not eliminated—her bleeding.

Nearby cities and towns such as Donggala were similarly devastated, but relief crews have been unable to reach them yet, reports the AP. The 7.5-magnitude quake struck around dusk Friday, and it set off a tsunami at least 10 feet high that toppled buildings as it came ashore. Reuters has the estimate at 18 feet high. The BBC has video here. \"We hope there will be international satellites crossing over Indonesia that can capture images and provide them to us so we can use the images to prepare humanitarian aid,\" says a disaster agency spokesman. In the meantime, hospitals are overwhelmed with the injured. Many of the victims were swept away while on the beach, preparing for a major festival in Palu. “The tsunami didn’t come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land,” says the disaster official.\\n',\n",

Rock sent a statement to Megyn Kelly at Fox News, saying, \"Please tell the people who are protesting to kiss my ass/Ask me some questions.\" Kelly quoted it in a video available on her Facebook page, editing his words to read, \"kiss my ... ask me some questions,\" she says. \"I modified that.\" Raised in Michigan, Rock lives on an estate in Alabama and uses the Confederate flag \"to highlight his Rebel Soul, the name of his 2012 album,\" Rolling Stone says.

Bao Bao is scheduled to leave the zoo Tuesday morning and fly from Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia to Chengdu, China, on Tuesday afternoon. The Washington Post explains that most of the giant pandas scattered at zoos around the globe are loaned from China, and cubs born outside of that country are usually returned there before they turn 4 to take part in the breeding program. Bao Bao won\\'t have to worry about finding overhead bin space or dealing with a talkative seatmate on the nonstop 16-hour flight: She\\'ll be the only panda on the plane, traveling with a keeper and a veterinarian. In preparation for the trip, keepers have packed Bao Bao\\'s favorite foods, including bamboo, apples, and sweet potatoes. \"I\\'m sad but happy,\" one of Bao Bao\\'s regular visitors tells the Post, comparing the cub\\'s departure to \"sending a kid off to college.\" (Giant pandas were recently taken off the endangered-species list.)\\n',\n",

Authorities say the infant—full term but likely less than a day old, with the umbilical cord and placenta still attached, per WGN—had perhaps been left outside overnight and spent hours in the sun before Elysia found her while playing outside Monday morning. Her mom, Heidi Laub, \"realized exactly what she had found,\" Lake County Sheriff John Buncich tells ABC 7. Laub says there were maggots on the placenta, per Patch.com. But except for sunburns, the child was in good health, Buncich says.

London\\'s Times (via the Australian) calls him \"Russia\\'s Osama bin Laden.\" He pledged in July to \"use all means\" to stop the Sochi Olympics, which he likened to \"demonic dances on the bones of our ancestors.\" In the 1990s, Umarov was an insurgent against the Russian Federation, NBC News reports. In 2007, after years pushing for Chechen independence, he called for Northern Caucasus to become a united Islamic state under Sharia law. He and his followers have been linked to a number of attacks. His group claimed responsibility for a 2009 blast at a Siberian hydroelectric plant and an explosion on a Russian train, both of which killed dozens. Umarov said he was behind suicide bombings in 2010 on the Moscow subway and, the next year, at a Moscow airport. Last year, he was said to be involved in an alleged plot to kill Vladimir Putin.

Its first report on turkey meat gets off to a happy start by noting that \"more than half of the packages of raw ground meat and patties tested positive for fecal bacteria.\" The magazine tested for five organisms—enterococcus, E. coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella, and campylobacter—and at least one showed up in 90% of the 257 samples, reports CBS News. CR says most of the contaminants it found were resistant to common antibiotics and blamed the overuse of drugs in feedlots. Products labeled \"organic\" or \"no antibiotics\" fared much better in this area, and the magazine encouraged their use. The turkey-meat industry is lashing back at what it calls a \"misleading\" and too-small study. Of the contaminants found, it writes, \"the two most prevalent, enterococcus and generic E.coli, are not considered sources of foodborne illness.\" It also notes that only 5% of the samples tested positive for salmonella, adding: \"This is borne out by more extensive government testing, which finds almost 90% of all ground turkey and 97% of whole turkeys are salmonella-free.\" At the Wall Street Journal, Tom Gara isn\\'t exactly bowled over by that argument. \"You know it’s a tough news day when an industry association boasts its product is almost 90% salmonella-free.\"\\n',\n",

House Bill 155—which would go into effect right before New Year\\'s Eve on Dec. 30, 2018, if Gov. Gary Herbert signs off—passed in the state Senate Wednesday, Fox 13 reports. Herbert\\'s office informed the station he would indeed approve the measure. All other states currently have DUI limits set at 0.08% (though the AP notes that limit may vary for commercial drivers and those who have past DUIs), which would make Utah\\'s the lowest in the country once it\\'s given the governor\\'s OK. The National Transportation Safety Board wants all states to follow suit, notes the Salt Lake Tribune. Republican Rep. Norman Thurston, the bill\\'s sponsor, compares the new limit to lower ones in Canada and some EU countries, asserting the measure will cut down on deaths. But critics say the ceiling—which the American Beverage Institute says a 120-pound woman may hit after just one drink, depending on how much she\\'s eaten—will mar the state\\'s hospitality and tourism industries and make the Mormon-leaning state look more \"peculiar\" to outsiders, as one senator put it. The managing director of the ABI also argues that most DUI-related deaths are tied to drivers who well exceed legal limits. Still, the law may keep those who\\'ve imbibed from \"getting behind the wheel in the first place,\" says GOP Senate Majority Whip Stuart Adams. (An alcohol-gauging tat, maybe?)\\n',\n",

In that earlier incident, Gonzalez allegedly had a sawed off shotgun, two powerful rifles, four handguns, and other guns and ammunition in his Ford Bronco when troopers stopped him in southwestern Virginia on July 19. Officials say Gonzalez initially tried to flee troopers, weaving and driving onto a highway median. He was arrested at the scene after a trooper found the illegal shotgun in his car. Gonzalez also had a map of Washington, DC, and camping equipment. In another incident, Gonzalez was apparently walking by the White House with a hatchet in his waistband and was stopped by Secret Service officers but not detained. Gonzalez's White House break-in—for which he faces up to 10 years in prison—has triggered a review of how the US Secret Service failed to stop him.

More than 130 imams and other Muslim religious leaders from \"diverse\" backgrounds across the UK have penned a letter not only blasting the attacks, but also imploring other religious figureheads to refuse to carry out Islamic funeral prayers for the \"terrorists.\" \"We have come together to express our shock and utter disgust at these cold-blooded murders,\" the letter, as seen on the Muslim Council of Britain website Monday, reads. \"We seek to clarify that their reprehensible actions have neither legitimacy nor our sympathy\" and that \"such indefensible actions are completely at odds with the lofty teachings of Islam,\" the note continues on the site, which adds such rites are \"a ritual that is normally performed for every Muslim regardless of their actions.\" The letter-writers refer to the suspects as \"murderers who seek to gain religious legitimacy for their actions\" and note that the attacks came during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, proving further that the killers had only \"contempt\" for the true Muslim faith. The authors go on to express their support for local law enforcement and first responders, who they say are the ones who displayed the \"courage, humanity, and honor we must exhibit in such difficult times.\" The official letter comes one day after MCB Secretary General Harun Khan told reporters that \"the level of our anger\" was so great that some had started saying \"these people should be denied an Islamic burial.\" CNN notes that mosques in both the UK and the US have turned their backs on burying terrorists after attacks in the recent past.

       " '– France 24\\'s Sonia Dridi has become the latest female foreign journalist to fall victim to mob violence in Cairo. She was attacked and groped by around 30 men while reporting live on protests in the city\\'s Tahrir Square, the Guardian reports. Her colleague Ashraf Khalil, assisted by a few bystanders, managed to get her to safety in a restaurant that closed its metal doors to keep the mob at bay. The network says its employees are safe, but \"extremely shocked\" by the attack. \"The crowd surged in and then it went crazy. It was basically me keeping her in a bear hug, both arms around her and face-to-face,\" Khalil tells the AP. CBS\\' Lara Logan was beaten and sexually assaulted in the same square last year. \"Sexual violence is a way of denying women journalists access to the story in Egypt,\" Logan told the New York Daily News after hearing of the latest attack. \"It’s not accidental. It’s by design.\"\\n',\n",
       " '– A week before his wedding, Aaron Peers doesn\\'t have cold feet, but rather burnt hands. While making margaritas outside with bride-to-be Alyse Golden over Memorial Day weekend, a little lime juice dripped down his fingers and hands and onto his arm as he was squeezing the limes. A day later, the man from Jacksonville, Fla., noticed red burns developing on his skin, and within 48 hours, a huge blister also appeared, First Coast News reports. ER doctors told Peers he had fallen victim to a little-known reaction caused when citric acid mixes with the sun\\'s rays, dubbed \"margarita dermatitis,\" or \"lime disease.\" Essentially, the acid makes skin hypersensitive to sunlight, and exposure can cause nasty burns, blisters, or brown spots, the Daily Express and Women\\'s Health report. It isn\\'t just limes you need to watch out for: Lemons, carrots, celery, bergamot oranges, parsnips, and dill can also inflame the skin. Dr. Douglas Robins says he sees about a dozen patients each year affected by what is officially known as phytophotodermatitis and that it can take years to bleach skin back to normal. While some people react differently, \"everyone is susceptible.\" Left with second-degree burns, Peers says Photoshop will be a big help for wedding photos. \"The blistering is gone and now I\\'m left with really bright pink skin,\" he says, adding his wedding ring might not make it on his finger. \"Tried it on the other day. It barely fit.\" Peers and his fiancee have also postponed their dream honeymoon in Hawaii as Peers will have to stay out of the sun for a while. To avoid a similar fate, Robins recommends making summer cocktails indoors before enjoying them in the sunshine. (How McDonald\\'s allegedly treats burns: with mustard.)\\n',\n",
       " '– Another blow for Lionel Messi: The star soccer player was sentenced to 21 months in jail for tax fraud in a Barcelona court Wednesday, but don\\'t expect that to keep him from the soccer field. Messi is unlikely to serve time behind bars since jail sentences under two years in Spain can be served under probation for first-time offenders, reports the BBC. He does, however, face $2.2 million in fines for using tax havens in Belize and Uruguay to hide millions from image rights, per the Telegraph. Prosecutors argued $4.5 million was moved to Switzerland and Britain, then to offshore companies in Belize and Uruguay from 2007 to 2009, reports USA Today. During testimony last month, however, Messi said he \"had no idea where the money was going,\" per the Telegraph. \"I just concentrated on playing football. I trusted my father.\" Messi\\'s father, Jorge Messi, was also found guilty of tax fraud and sentenced to 21 months, though he\\'s not expected to serve time, either. He must pay $1.6 million.\\n',\n",
       " '– Tom Brady filed an appeal just days after the league suspended him for four games over Deflategate—but the Patriots have given up and won\\'t be fighting the league\\'s punishment, CBS News reports. In a five-minute press conference today out of San Francisco, where the league is holding spring meetings, owner Robert Kraft said even though he found the discipline—a $1 million fine and two lost draft picks, including one in the first round—\"unreasonable and unprecedented,\" he \"reluctantly\" conceded that dropping the appeal would be best for all involved, NESN reports. \"The entire process is taking way too long,\" he said. \"I can end [this controversy] or extend it.\" This followed an ESPN report that Kraft and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell were having \"back-channel conversations\" to avoid legal action. Although MMQB compared the Goodell-Kraft relationship to that of Obama-Putin, there have been signs the chill was thawing: ESPN\\'s Adam Schefter tweeted this morning that the two were spotted hugging it out. But a league source reportedly told Schefter that the NFL asked the Patriots to suspend Jim McNally and John Jastremski (the two employees whose texts allegedly pointed to deflating) before the Pats received their punishment, and that the team \"obliged,\" as ESPN puts it—which wouldn\\'t make a lot of sense if there\\'s no proof of ball deflation, as the Pats keep insisting. An NFL rep denies ESPN\\'s report. Meanwhile, MMQB asked Kraft in an \"alternately defiant and angry\" phone call over the weekend why he suspended the two, and Kraft \"refused comment—for what he claimed were a variety of reasons,\" the site notes. (A Time writer says Brady shouldn\\'t have been suspended at all.)\\n',\n",
       " '– Cornell Iral Haynes Jr. is in trouble with the taxman, but you may be able to help. You also might be more inclined to lend a hand if you recognize Mr. Haynes by his stage name, Nelly, and realize that it would take just a few minutes on Spotify to help dig the rapper out of his IRS mess. TMZ reported Sunday that Nelly was slammed with a $2,412,283 federal tax lien last month, added on to a Missouri state tax bill from earlier this year of nearly $150,000 (he originally owed just $113,000 and change, but the interest racked up). Spin magazine calls his financial conundrum \"tragic\" and says the singer \"deserves better\"—and it suggests a way everyone can help. The magazine\\'s grand plan: Get as many people as possible to stream his hit song \"Hot in Herre\"—or \"Ride Wit Me\" or any other tunes from the Nelly discography—to generate funds for the artist. Based on Spotify\\'s estimation that the average \"per stream\" payout to the owner of a song\\'s rights is between $0.006 and $0.0084, Spin calculates Nelly would need, at minimum, 287,176,547 streams to help him pay down the federal tax bill, with an additional 17.8 million streams to appease Missouri—and that\\'s if we assume he\\'s on the $0.0084 end of things and that his labels and publishers, who would also get a cut, will be generous. Still, hope springs eternal: People are responding in a generally positive manner to the #HotInHerreStreamingParty and #SaveNelly hashtags. \"I couldn\\'t save Harambe but god----it I\\'m saving you @Nelly_Mo,\" writes one fan. (Last year wasn\\'t a good year for Nelly on the legal front.)\\n',\n",

Venice Beach jewelry store Kamofie & Co. sold the tape to a Beverly Hills software company, which is promising to stream the tape exclusively on its necklacevideo.com site, notes ABC News. It hasn\\'t said when. \"Speculation as to what occurred that day has been the subject of intense rumor,\" says a statement on the website. \"Many individuals want to see the video streams from the jewelry store\\'s surveillance cameras, and we have obtained the exclusive license for them,\" the statement adds. \"The tapes speak for themselves.\" Entertainment Tonight has obtained stills of the video and plans to air footage of Lohan\\'s shopping trip today.

U2 made a surprise appearance and unexpectedly announced that a) it has a new album out, and b) all 500 million iTunes users can download Songs of Innocence for free, the AP reports. The band made the announcement about the 11-song album along with Apple CEO Tim Cook, noting that non-iTunes users will have to wait until Oct. 14. According to Forbes, Bono and gang first played a new song called \"The Miracle (of Joey Ramone).\" Then Cook started bantering with the group\\'s frontman, exclaiming, \"Wasn\\'t that the most incredible single you ever heard? We would love a whole album of that.\" Bono replied, \"I do believe you have over half a billion subscribers to iTunes, so—could you get this to them?\" Cook\\'s response: \"If we gave it away for free.\" Some say U2 allowed itself to get upstaged by the Apple extravaganza—Vulture notes that the combo gadget/album release was \"not so cool.\" The band\\'s 13th studio album (and the first in five years) is getting mixed reviews: Jon Pareles of the New York Times calls the album a \"blast of unapologetic arena rock and cathedral-scale production,\" while Brian Mansfield writes for USA Today that it \"may not provide that miracle moment for many.\"\\n',\n",
       " '– To err is human, and deadly when those humans are doctors. Major surgical errors are pretty rare—some estimates put them at one in 12,000 surgeries—but they do happen, even egregious ones like leaving instruments behind or performing the wrong surgery altogether. Mayo Clinic researchers recently set out to find out why by analyzing 69 such events that occurred over the course of 1.5 million invasive surgeries in a five-year period. Reporting in the journal Surgery, they found that \"never events\" (meaning ones that should never happen) occurred once in every 22,000 surgeries in this window, and that those included 24 wrong surgeries, 22 involving the wrong side or site, 18 instances of leaving an object in the patient, and five wrong implants. The researchers used the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System—initially developed to investigate military aviation accidents—and organized errors into four types, reports the Mayo Clinic: preconditions for action, like overconfidence and inadequate communication; unsafe actions, like breaking rules or confirmation bias; oversight factors, like poor staffing and planning; and organizational influences, such as problems with operational processes. They found that most major errors involve an average of nine missteps, and that mental states of doctors and nurses (e.g., overconfidence and stress) were the most common source of errors, reports Pacific Standard. And while they didn\\'t get specific on how to mitigate these errors, they did note that lightening the workload should ease the error rate. (Hospitals appear to profit from these mistakes.)\\n',\n",
       " '– Before dying by car bomb last October, Maltese journalist Daphne Galizia was swamped with online threats. She even hesitated to keep reporting on issues like government corruption and the Panama Papers. \"The dehumanization by the time she was killed around that period was complete,\" says her son Paul. It turns out that Galizia, like many reporters and activists worldwide, was targeted by a government-backed troll army designed to intimidate and discredit her in a cyber-world with few enforceable boundaries, Bloomberg reports. A new report by a global research group shows how countries are using such trolls to squelch dissent, often via fake social-media accounts, using various kinds of labor—like party youth groups, volunteer armies, government workers, or paid contractors who specialize in trolling. In India, Prime Minister Modi\\'s BJP Party apparently had a troll farm threatening opponents with \"slaughter\" during the 2014 election. In Turkey, President Erdogan\\'s party lured critics into downloading software that secretly monitored their communications and movements, per AccessNow. Similar online horrors have cropped up in Ecuador, Venezuela, and—with Russian trolling against Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election—the US as well. Which raises the question: Why now? Evidence suggests that countries are sharing information and learning how to cover their tracks. \"That\\'s the genius of these types of attacks,\" says an author of the global report by the Institute for the Future. \"It\\'s hard to distinguish between what\\'s being manufactured on purpose and what is a popular uprising of opinion against the target.\" (See how a text message ended Galizia\\'s life.)\\n',\n",

A leading Fatah figure tells the AP that Ziad Abu Ain was hit by a tear gas canister shot by Israeli troops, while Palestinian health officials say he was suffocated by the tear gas, the BBC reports. Another witness, a Reuters photographer, says Israeli troops hit and pushed Abu Ain, the BBC notes. Mahmoud Aloul, of Fatah, says Abu Ain was involved in a protest against confiscated land that was met with tear gas and troops\\' rifle butts. \"The Israel government bears full responsibility for the killing of Minster Abu Ain and the systematic crimes committed against the Palestinian people,\" said Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat, as per NBC. \"This new assassination will have severe consequences.\" Israel is reviewing the situation, the Guardian reports, noting that Abu Ain\\'s work involved addressing the matter of Israeli settlements.\\n',\n",
       " '– Anyone who\\'s struggled with mood swings while on hormonal birth control may not be surprised to hear that a new study suggests using such birth control could increase the risk of depression. Researchers from the University of Copenhagen looked at more than a million women ages 15 to 34, about 55% of whom were using hormonal contraception or had been on it during the past six months. (Often, people who quit birth control due to depressive symptoms aren\\'t included in such studies, and the scientists wanted to make sure that wasn\\'t the case for this one, Health.com reports.) The scientists theorize that progesterone, as well as the synthetic version of the hormone, progestin, has something to do with the development of depression. They found that women on a progestin-only pill were 34% more likely to have been prescribed an antidepressant than women who weren\\'t on hormonal contraception, and women who were on a pill containing both progestin and estrogen were 23% more likely. In addition, women who were using a progestin-only IUD were 40% more likely, women using a vaginal ring containing hormones were 60% more likely, and women using a patch containing hormones were 100% more likely, the researchers report in their paper, published in JAMA Psychiatry. The numbers are even more striking when teens are isolated: Teenage girls who were on progestin-only pills were 120% more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant than non-users, or 80% more likely if they were on a combined pill; for those on non-oral hormonal contraception, the risk was multiplied by three. This is possibly because teens are already more susceptible to depression, the New York Times reports. \"Doctors should ensure that women, especially young women, are not already depressed or have a history of depression\" before prescribing hormonal birth control, the lead author tells Health.com. (Another study finds that most antidepressants don\\'t work for kids and teens.)\\n',\n",

The former May-December Hollywood couple recently raised eyebrows by embracing for an intense 60 seconds at a party for the rabbi who had officiated their marriage. Moore stared at Kutcher \"like a love-suck puppy,\" a source says, before he gave a speech with deep undertones: “I’ve made all these horrendous mistakes in the last year,\" he said. “Ashton’s voice started to break as he spoke,\" says the source. \"He just fell into tears.

       " '– A pregnant Alabama woman who suffered a miscarriage at six weeks can sue her doctor for wrongful death, the Alabama Supreme Court has ruled, with judges citing a 2009 state law making it a crime to kill or harm \"an unborn child in utero at any stage of development.\" Physicians who make mistakes are usually protected from civil suits, and a lower court in August dismissed the wrongful death portion of Kimberly Stinnett\\'s claim. But the high court overruled that last week in a unanimous decision that \"reaffirms the principle that unborn children are protected by Alabama\\'s wrongful-death statute from the moment life begins,\" writes Judge Tom Parker, per AL.com. The ruling is a swipe at Roe v. Wade, which Parker has previously called \"incoherent\" because \"life begins at conception.\" The case goes back to May 2012, when Stinnett sought treatment for abdominal cramps and fever. An ER obstetrician who treated her suspected an ectopic pregnancy and performed a dilation and curettage, AL.com reports, followed by an injection of a drug intended to stop the pregnancy. The Helena woman had a history of two miscarriages and one ectopic pregnancy. A follow-up ultrasound by Stinnett\\'s regular OB-GYN showed the pregnancy was uterine but failing, possibly because of the injection. In June, Stinnett miscarried and filed a civil lawsuit against the doctor who first treated her. ProPublica has written that Parker\\'s writings pose \"the biggest threat to abortion in a generation,\" but the ruling was cheered by the chair of Liberty Counsel \"for defending the legal rights of the unborn as clearly stated in Alabama law.\" (A study finds a miscarriage can be followed by PTSD.)\\n',\n",

      "The Da Vinci Code has sold so many copies—that would be at least 80 million—that it's bound to turn up in book donation piles. But at one charity shop in the UK, it's been donated so heavily that the shop has posted a sign propped up on a tower of Da Vinci Code copies that reads: \"You could give us another Da Vinci Code... but we would rather have your vinyl!\" The manager of the Oxfam shop in Swansea tells the Telegraph that people are laughing and taking pictures of the sizable display: \"I would say that we get one copy of the book every day.\" He says people buy them \"occasionally,\" but with vinyl sales up 25% in the past year, they'd rather take records. Dan Brown's book isn't the only one that shops like Oxfam struggle to re-sell. Last year, Oxfam was hit with a large and steady supply of Fifty Shades of Grey, and it similarly begged donors: \"Please—no more.\" But Brown has a particular kind of staying power. The Da Vinci Code was published in 2003, and within six years Brown had booted John Grisham from the No. 1 slot on the list of writers whose books were most often donated to Oxfam's 700 shops, reported the Guardian at the time. The Independent in 2012 reported Brown's best-seller was the most-donated book for the fourth year running. (See why Dan Brown took heat from the Philippines.)\n",

Expectations are for 203,000 new jobs to be created, according to economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires, compared to 227,000 jobs added in February. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 8.3%.\\n[4] Here at MarketBeat HQ, we’ll be offering color commentary before and after the data crosses the wires. Feel free to weigh-in yourself, via the comments section. And while you’re here, why don’t you sign up to follow us on Twitter.\\n[5] Enjoy the show.\\n[6] Employers pulled back sharply on hiring last month, a reminder that the U.S. economy may not be growing fast enough to sustain robust job growth. The unemployment rate dipped, but mostly because more Americans stopped looking for work.\\n[7] The Labor Department says the economy added 120,000 jobs in March, down from more than 200,000 in each of the previous three months.\\n[8] The unemployment rate fell to 8.2 percent, the lowest since January 2009. The rate dropped because fewer people searched for jobs. The official unemployment tally only includes those seeking work.\\n[9] The economy has added 858,000 jobs since December _ the best four months of hiring in two years. But Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has cautioned that the current hiring pace is unlikely to continue without more consumer spending.\\n<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n**Answer**\\n**Summary**\\nThe unemployment rate dropped to 8.2% last month, but the economy only added 120,000 jobs, when 203,000 new jobs had been predicted, according to today\\'s jobs report. Reaction on the Wall Street Journal\\'s MarketBeat Blog was swift: \"Woah!!! Bad number.\" The unemployment rate, however, is better news; it had been expected to hold steady at 8.3%. But the AP notes that the dip is mostly due to more Americans giving up on seeking employment.\\n<|im_end|>\\n'}\n"
